		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph {"dropCap":true} -->
<p class="has-drop-cap">As clandestine meeting places go, a laundromat was an unexpected choice. Yet that's exactly where the Apple TV+ series Slow Horses, an adaptation of the Mick Herron novel by the same name, decides to take the action by the end of its second episode. It's a move characteristic of the eccentric but charming series, which rebels against the traditions of the spy thriller by focusing the action on MI5's worst and dimmest (or, as the show's theme song calls them, "misfits and losers, hanging by a thread"). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Season 1, golden boy River Cartwright was punished for a dangerous mistake during an MI5 training exercise with an assignment to Slough House: a dead end unit where the agency's screwups are sent to while away their remaining years before retirement somewhere they can do no harm. Unfortunately for them, and possibly for the world, River's refusal to give up on a lead eventually drags the whole motley crew of oddballs — the hacker, the wise guy, the hotshot, the old hand, and of course their underestimated but acerbically witty leader Jackson Lamb — into a surprisingly nail-biting chase to uncover an illegal op in the heart of MI5 and, in doing so, save an innocent London immigrant from assassination by a white supremacist terror cell. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:columns -->
<div class="wp-block-columns"><!-- wp:column -->
<div class="wp-block-column"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The series' premiere, which I adored for many reasons, brilliantly mixed that peculiarly British brand of dark humor with the tension of a classic MI5 story and the grounding of a political thriller. Season 2, which premiered on Apple TV+ in early December, brings all of that to the table and more, but as it ups the stakes it loses something of the first season's frightening realism. In the new installment, which shares little more than a set of shared characters with the first, Slow Horse leader Jackson Lamb sets out to avenge his old agency comrade Dickie Bo, who he believes has been assassinated by Cold War era sleeper agents known as cicadas. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, the idea that a deep cover operative planted before the fall of the Berlin Wall has been living in London undetected for decades seems ridiculous to the point of insanity to MI5 command, so Lamb turns to his resident bunch of crazy people (hey, team!) to solve the case. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cue the music, hop on a motorcycle and be ready to give chase, this high-flying adventure will be shaken, not stirred. And indeed, the Slow Horses' second outing has the feel of a Bond story, much more so than their first. Episode 2, "From Upshott With Love," makes the show's heritage clear with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Russia_with_Love_(film)">explicit reference</a> to Fleming's work, not to mention providing us with the entertaining spectacle of River's terrible attempt to go undercover as a "local journalist." (Seriously, has that guy ever met a journalist? The fact that the Russians don't shoot him on sight is a minor miracle.)</p>

<!-- /wp:image --></div>

<!-- wp:column -->
<div class="wp-block-column"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet, while I enjoy this season's spy spectacle — complete with car chases, skyscraper shootouts, radioactive poisons, and a guy's thumb getting cut off for reasons I still don't fully understand — I find myself missing the gritty, edge of your seat tension of the series premiere. The first chase, six bad spies against four domestic terrorists, was gripping precisely because it was so disturbingly, chillingly plausible. That could happen, it has happened, and as a result the message season one left in its wake — a story of the misfit, imperfect and inevitably flawed heroes who nevertheless stand against hate, no matter what — was all the more powerful. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div>
<!-- /wp:column --></div>
<!-- /wp:columns -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Season 2, with its focus on Cold War lore, feels like a regression to an earlier, now vanished era, when spies were still unquestioned heroes and "communism" was a realistic threat to UK national security. While the twists of the season finale begin to steer the story back into the grey, I remain disappointed that the series' return to screen lost some of the innovative brilliance of its first outing, yet hopeful that Season 3, which is already in production, will be well worth the wait. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>My girlfriend doesn't want to hang out in the car all day talking about bears in basements, but instead wants to go inside to the function. Waddado?? From, Sleepy South of Seattle</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your girlfriend doesn’t want to hang out in the car all day talking about bears because bears are a pretty abstract concept in North Portland. She wants to taste the marrow of life. On that note, what if your bear story was better? More personal? What if it was a tale of a basement bear encounter that caused you to face your own mortality, to stop treating your work as a cosplay and really take a hard reset.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alternatively, you would not have this problem if your girlfriend was a bear. It’s not a straightforward answer, and your current girlfriend might not always understand, but it might be easier in the long run. Bears naturally have more sympathy with stories of their own kind-it’s like how humans always assume the character in a story is a human (we’re so human-centric!). She’ll probably want to chill with you in a basement and not want to go out to the functions or whatever. She might also be better at pool. You could get a pool table in the basement. You could tell stories, to a bear in a basement, about a bear in a basement, while you play pool. It’s really the best of both worlds.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the end of the day, what is really important is that personal touch - that extra bit of effort. You must come face-to-face with your own story here, one way or another.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It might help to be mauled by a bear.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Dearest Fates, I can't seem to do any of my work. I have many final assignments that I simply don't want to do. What's your advice for getting back on track?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You’re struggling with your work because it feels distant and abstract from you. It’s not part of your story and you’re not part of its story. There’s an “I” hovering above what you’re doing that’s getting in the way. In some way, it might be the “I”, and not the work, holding you back. It’s not personal. In the end, if school is going to be meaningful, you’re going to have to hold it very close to you, the way you might hold a 300 lb honey-breathed female black bear. Now this embrace might be loving at times, tender, even passionate and other times it might be suffocating, heavy to move under, even dangerous, a heaving thing armed with three-inch claws and two thousand pounds of biting strength. And it might bite you, and you might need this to happen, even if it’s just to know that you can survive it. But no matter what, you must hold it close. You’re somewhere in a basement, huddled in fear under a pool table as you watch a bear pace circles around you. In times like these, what you need is a “hard reset.” These can come in many different forms, like mindblowing sex, or a trip to the ER, or a hot marrow soup, a sleepless night followed by a good hard sleep, crying into the night, immanentizing the eschaton, getting caught in torrential rain, becoming martyred, seeing a psychic → texting your ex → crashing your car<strong>, </strong>caring for a child, skiing for your life, sticking your hand in a candle, and “Careless Whisper” by George Michael. As long as the process causes you to transcend your own subjectivity. You need to come face-to-face with your work, and with yourself. You need to take it personally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“A CSO responded to McKinley residence hall to take a theft report. The CSO met with a student who reported that they had left their backpack, containing their laptop and some books, in the upper common room overnight and when they returned to retrieve it, it was gone. The student stated that they had asked other dorm residents if they had seen it and none had.”</p>

<p>“A CSO responded to a report of an individual stealing food from Commons. When the CSO arrived, they encountered the same excluded individual from the morning prior.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Based on information received, the director of Community Safety, along with a Community Safety manager and a Residence Life representative, performed a room search in a residence hall. Multiple types of illicit drugs and a distributable amount of cannabis were recovered.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Its times like these that really inhibit Reed’s savvy, young, entrepreneurs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1524; Cannabis use or Possession; Canyon</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“While walking along a canyon path, the director of Community Safety encountered the odor of cannabis. When he looked in the direction from which the odor was emanating, he saw two individuals sitting at a nearby picnic table. When the director approached, he observed one of the two individuals holding a pipe that appeared to contain cannabis. The individual confirmed that the pipe did contain cannabis, and proceeded to empty the contents of the pipe. Both individuals at the table identified themselves as students. Both students agreed that only the one holding the pipe had consumed any cannabis. The director wished them a good rest of their day and continued on to his destination.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;Good on that student for not ratting out their friend.</p>

The CSO entered the building behind the individuals and saw a total of five individuals in the hallway attempting to hide glass bottles. Upon speaking with the individuals, all confirmed to be students, the actions were initially denied. However, one of the students then stated that they were attempting to “blow off steam” after a rough day. The students apologized for the mess and potential danger they had put their fellow students in and cleaned up the glass to the best of their abilities.”</p>

<p>“A CSO on patrol near the amphitheater encountered an individual with a dog that was unleashed. The CSO requested the individual leash their dog, at which time the individual, without acknowledging the CSO, got up and began walking north, away from them. The CSO reiterated that they were a Community Safety officer and that the individual was on private property. The individual turned around and told the CSO to stop following them. The CSO explained that the individual would be excluded from campus if they did not leash their dog. The individual again told the CSO to stop following them and that if they did not, the individual would tase them. At this time the CSO stated that the individual was excluded from Reed property and that if the individual tased the CSO, the CSO would file charges against them. The CSO explained the reason for the leash policy and also provided information regarding the off-leash dog areas. The individual continued walking north. Per the Community Safety directive regarding excluding individuals, the CSO took a picture of the individual and stated so, and also stated that the photo would be shared with the other CSOs and that should the individual be seen again on campus Portland Police would be contacted. The individual told the CSO to call the police right then, so the CSO requested that the Dispatcher contact Portland Police. The individual continued walking northward, with the CSO following. The individual then stated that they did not want to see the CSO again. When the CSO asked if the individual was threatening the safety of the CSO, the individual confirmed it. The individual continued walking northward until they were off of Reed property. The CSO requested Dispatch cancel the Portland Police response and then continued on their patrols.”</p>

<p>Species: Red-tailed Hawk, or <em>Buteo jamaicensis</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Family: Accipitridae (Hawks, Eagles, and Kites)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Star sign: Leo</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rating: 14/10</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ideal Date: You know the finale of<em> </em><em>Singin’ in the Rain</em>, where Lina Lamont is lip synching to Kathy Selden, who’s singing live behind the stage curtain, and they pull up the curtain and everyone realizes that Kathy Selden was the real talented singer all along, and then she gets to make out with Gene Kelly? Yeah, basically imagine that but with birds. 2</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You may think there’s nothing special about the Red-tailed Hawk. Sure, they’re beautiful, majestic raptors that can often be seen soaring high above campus on the north wind, their feathers spread open, their brilliant russet-red tails glistening in the sunlight. But they’re so <em>passé</em>. So <em>pedestrian</em>. In this country, they’re inescapable to even the most bird-ignorant schmuck around, let alone any experienced birder; there is a tangible sort of disappointment that comes with thinking you might have spotted an exciting new hawk friend, only to realize that it is just a particularly drab Red-tailed Hawk. But this reputation is wholly unearned, and is disrespectful not only to the glorious soaring powers of this magnificent beast, but also to his most important, unique, and special skill: his voice.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because the thing is,<em> you know his voice.</em> You’ve heard it, whispering on the wind. But more importantly: you’ve heard it whispering quite loudly and audibly on the silver screen! His fierce, piercing, gorgeous call, resounding across the landscape and clear through your Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound System: <em>SCKRAAAAAAAWWWWW!!!!!! </em>In every movie and every tv show ever produced in this nation, whenever a director needs a powerful, booming voice for whatever manner of falcon, hawk, or kite they are trying to depict, they have always turned to one particularly skilled voice actor, and that is of course, our friend the Red-tailed Hawk. The reason is that most raptors… actually have really pathetic, mewling calls! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of them sound like they’d be better fit to be the voices of jittery songbirds or 1990s Disney movie ingenues. But not the Red-tailed Hawk. The Red-tailed Hawk has a voice more majestic and powerful and those of every other raptor combined. Like the Morgan Freeman of birds of prey. So naturally, the call of this talented trouper is used by Hollywood sound designers almost without fail to dub over the more pathetic yelps of other raptors, most often the hack fraud Bald Eagle (though I suppose that must be in character for a bird that symbolizes America). But don’t get it twisted! The Red-tailed Hawk is the real talent behind the throne. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want to see one of these powerful performers, you needn’t look far. They are ubiquitous in the United States, easily the most common and frankly, <em>unavoidable </em>raptor in the country. But if you’re having trouble identifying them: Red-tailed hawks are on the larger and stockier side for Hawks, though nowhere near as large as your typical Eagle; while their plumage is subject to some regional variation, they generally have white undersides (under-wings and chests) and dark brown on their heads, backs, and the tops of their wings. They also have piercing yellow eyes. Their tails, as the name implies, are a brilliant red-brown color, serving as an incredibly distinctive identifier if you can spot it. Additionally, they have a unique mottling pattern on their chest, a horizontal band of dark brown spots which runs across their chests. They are very often spotted soaring high in the air, especially above wide-open spaces, and at Reed there’s a good chance that if you look into the clear blue sky you’ll see one soaring over the great lawn or the sports fields, perhaps even being harassed by crows. But even beyond those things, never forget that beautiful, distinctive, iconic call; Hollywood may pretend that their voice belongs to someone else, but never forget the true artist behind that bone-chilling cry, and pray to whatever Gods you believe in that no one ever decides to replace the Red-tailed Hawk with Chris Pratt.</p>

<p><em>Goes awoof!</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Names: Indie</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Breed: Australian Shepherd&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Age: 4 Years</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rating: 14/10</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Australian Shepherds are known as very active dogs, and so when I met Indie I wasn’t surprised that she was pulling at her leash the whole time. Occasionally she would make little “awoof” noises, as if she was letting us know that she was not happy with having to stay in one spot while her owner and I talked. One really cool thing about Indie is that she has multicolored eyes! One of them is a light blue and the other is mostly brown with a little bit of blue in them! She also has a little secret, her full name isn’t actually Indie, it’s Indica! Although I think Indie works a little better. She is <em>not</em> a very calm dog. In fact, she is more like the Indie 500!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s also really smart! She knows how to high five! Sometimes she also tries to herd people by jumping up and pushing at their hips since Australian Shepherds are known for their herding prowess. If you want to pet Indie, you’ll easily find her around campus! Sometimes she hangs around commons if it’s not too wet. Just make sure you ask first and I’m sure she’ll love the attention!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Willam Trufant Foster, the namesake of the Foster dorm, was the first president of Reed College, appointed by Thomas Elliot in 1910 during the college's founding and remaining in the position until 1919. Foster’s contributions to Reed in its early years remain vital; however, recently, it has come to the <em>Quest’s</em> attention that Foster had ties to the eugenics movement in Oregon during this time. Prior to the rise of Nazism post-World War I, the eugenics movement looked slightly different that what initially comes to mind. A great deal of those involved in the movement in early 20th century America were part of organizations called social hygiene societies, which promoted sexual education against STDs and warned against sexual deviancy. On the surface, these groups do not seem to have bad intentions. However, this was not the case as they also advocated for race betterment, control of sexuality, and anti-immigration sentiments.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Foster had a leadership position in one of these groups, Oregon Social Hygiene Society(OSHS) during his time at Reed College. Working with the organization, he participated in discussions about race betterment and advocated for the control of sexuality. The most dramatic actions he committed with OSHS involved the persecution and forced shutdown of “quack doctors” and non-Western medicine practices. This involved legal action and even sheriff raids against apothecaries across Portland, a move that specifically targeted the cities’ Chinese community, as many of these establishments were owned and operated by them.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Knowing this, the harm that Foster caused to the Chinese community in Portland during his time with OSHS is undeniable. However these actions are only the tip of the iceberg of what OSHS was capable of doing. By the late 1910s, OSHS was advocating for a bill that would force sterilization against Oregon prison inmates, which ended up passing, resulting in the forced sterilization of over 1000 prison inmates by 1935. To get some clarification on these topics, the <em>Quest</em> talked with historian and Reed alumni Paul Edison-Lahm about Foster’s links to social hygiene in general. He mentioned that he could not find significant evidence that linked Foster to this legislation, or even that he advocated for it. During the time when OSHS began to advocate for this bill, Foster left the organization and then Reed College shortly after, following his service in the Red Cross during World War I.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regardless, Foster’s participation and role in OSHS is a well known fact, but several questions still remain. What exactly motivated him to join such an organization? Did he believe in the facade they promoted or was it because he was a fan of the works and beliefs of Woodrow Wilson? How deep did Foster spread the ideas of social hygiene within Reed? He definitely advocated for the control of sexuality at Reed, and other professors agreed with him. Perhaps most importantly, what are the effects of Foster and his ties to eugenics and social hygiene on Reed today? The answers to these questions certainly require much more research and exploration, as even in the 100 years since Foster worked at Reed his positive effects are still felt, and his negative effects are as well.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As announced at Public on Wednesday, Lennox Reeder has resigned from Senate. “We are another one down,” Student Body President Safi Zenger said. “Over the weekend Lennox Reeder resigned from their position as senator. There’s not really a whole lot else to say about it, unfortunately. I know that sounds really ominous, but resigning from a job is a personal decision, and we can’t speak on anyone’s behalf, so that’s really all that we can say about that.” Upon being contacted by the <em>Quest</em>, Reeder declined to comment on the situation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Notably, Public once again began without quorum, with eight members of student body government in attendance. SB President Safi Zenger shared that she had met with Registrar Jason Maher to set up a liaisonship moving forward, as well as with Vice President for Student Life Karnell McConnell-Black. As part of their regular meeting, McConnell-Black asked Senators how they are assessing campus climate in the wake of last week’s news that Professor Paul Currie is resigning. Zenger stated that at the meeting, she didn’t have “a lot concretely to say,” because while Senators are elected representatives, they can’t necessarily speak to the opinions of the whole student body. Zenger did share, however, that while “it’s great that Paul Currie is not returning, it’s still incredibly upsetting that he wasn’t found in violation of any school policies.” She further said that Senate was upset by the investigation’s findings, and assume that there are other students on campus who are upset that “our policies did not serve us the way that they should have.” Zenger also expressed her desire that students be involved in potential future institutional policy changes; at a meeting, Dean of Faculty Kathy Oleson personally agreed with Zenger’s desire for student involvement, though she could not confirm any official plans.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In her last Public as an elected representative, Vice President Margot Becker shared that Dean of Students Tawana Parks is putting together a student advisory group which Becker thinks could be involved in whatever policy changes come next. This will be a paid position, Becker said, but not under Senate, and she encouraged all those interested in such issues to apply once the details of that group are finalized. Meanwhile, Becker announced that she will be continuing to serve on the Student Committee on Academic Policy and Planning in her ex officio Vice Presidency, and her work toward revising the two day fall reading week will continue to be a priority next semester. "I'm really, really grateful to all the students who put me in this position and allowed me to serve here," Becker said, and thanked President Zenger, faculty and staff, and the student body as a whole, as well as everyone she worked with during her time on Senate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zenger further shared that she and Senator Kiana Cunningham-Rodriguez had met with Director of Academic Support Christy Martin and Associate Dean for Academic Life Steve Abrahão to discuss a proposal that students be allowed to know which HUM 110 conferences have a consultant in them before opting in to those classes. Martin and Steve also reportedly asked Zenger and Cunningham-Rodriguez for advice on improving the “Thriving at Reed” presentation given during O-Week. The presentation covers “things that are helpful not at the very beginning, but around the halfway mark,” Zenger said, so it’s important to help students retain the information throughout the year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cunningham-Rodriguez expressed excitement that Spring Fall was a success and attendees seemed to enjoy themselves. Cunningham-Rodriguez and Senator Wani Pandey are now looking toward next semester and planning how they can best support the Renn Fayre committee going forward. Meanwhile, Cunningham-Rodriguez met with Assistant Dean for Institutional Diversity Jessika Chi to discuss their ongoing project and the creation of a handbook for a bias reporting consultant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vice Treasurer Wani Pandey reiterated Cunningham-Rodriguez’s excitement about Spring Fall and begged all to send in their receipts as the end of the semester nears. "Please. Please. Send in your receipts,” Pandey said, “Please. I am begging you. Please. Please. Please. So when you're reading the <em>Quest </em>and you're reading these words, log into your computer, and send your receipts to money@reed.edu."&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reporting for their committees, Senator Jefferson Ratliff said that, prior to being interrupted by a fire alarm, the sustainability meeting primarily focused on implementing sustainability in curriculum and developing a working definition of sustainability — based on feedback from professors that the current definition is difficult to fit into practical applications. For Appointments Committee, Ratliff reported that interviews were conducted for accountability group positions, and Honor Council appointees were officially confirmed at the Senate executive meeting over the weekend. Finally, Ratliff reminded all that applications for Baby Money and Wage Review will be closing very soon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senate Secretary Miles Sanford announced that study abroad had approved a new consortium in Barcelona with three very big public universities. “The great thing,” Sanford said, “is that these programs are mainly offered in English, and you can take STEM classes in English.” Sanford also pointed out that, as a consortium, this study abroad program offers the advantage that a class not offered at one of the three colleges can simply be taken at one of the others. Sanford also said that they had discussed how pass/fail would be recorded at this new consortium, and mentioned the possibility of removing the residence requirement for thesis to make it easier for Reed students to study abroad.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thus concluded the semester’s last Senate public. As President Zenger put it, “Hopefully we never have a 9:00 a.m. Public ever again.”</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his 1992 science fiction novel "Snow Crash," Neal Stephenson coined the word "metaverse." To Stephenson's characters, the metaverse represents a sort of egalitarian ideal. Separate from the constraints of material reality, what you can achieve in the metaverse isn't limited by your wealth, but by your ability to arrange information, to program, to innovate. Sure, if you have a beefier computer you can get some fancier graphics for your avatar, and some places in the metaverse have started charging money for entry or use of their services, but who cares about graphics? And if you're really skilled enough, you can just create for yourself whatever great attraction is being held behind a paywall. People can copy code, share data. Information flows freely, at least when people don't go to great lengths to encrypt their precious files or disallow access to their little corner of the internet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>30 years later, the metaverse is pretty familiar to most of us, but it inspires more groans and dread than it does dreams of technological anarchism. What's happened is that the idea of property ownership, oh so important to maintaining the capitalist stability which the original metaverse was meant to subvert, has become central to the idea of the metaverse. The only people who seem stoked about it are Zuckerburg and an army of NFT diehards who manage to blend all the worst qualities of a finance bro and total loser computer science nerd. To understand why we got here and how NFTs have ruined the metaverse, we're going to have to rewind a bit and understand why bitcoin and blockchains were invented in the first place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Satoshi Nakamoto, or at least someone who went by that name, was very interested in moving money around on the internet. Electronic money transfers are basically a contract, and banks oversee these contracts to make sure that no one's committing fraud by spending money they don't have. Nakamoto didn't like this system. Having a bank in between to adjudicate issues like double payment seemed too cumbersome. Banks incur costs, they have to pay salaries to their employees and so on, so fees get added on to transactions like this. What Nakamoto wanted was a way to ensure that everyone involved in the online marketplace had access to the exact same information about the history of transactions without having to have a centralized authority like a bank keeping track of it all. What Nakamoto came up with was blockchain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The blockchain is this unified record (nerds call it a ledger) of all transactions. The beauty of the blockchain is that it's not a program, it's not like there's one computer out there keeping track of all the bitcoin commerce, instead it's a protocol. It's a way of sending information which ensures that everyone is on the same page. It includes its own history and synchronizes it across people using the protocol in such a way that to hack the ledger and make changes to it requires having control of the majority of computing power in the market which, if lots of people are making bitcoin transactions, becomes very hard to do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NFTs are an offshoot of Nakamoto's original blockchain. NFTs also exist on a blockchain, but instead of each block holding information about transfering money, each block can store arbitrary data. You could have a block contain a little message, an image, a piece of code. These items, or "tokens" aren't interchangeable with one another like bitcoins are. While one bitcoin is always equivalent to any other bitcoin, each NFT is a unique digital object. That’s where the “non fungible” part of “Non Fungible Token” comes from.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Any NFT bro fresh out of Twitter's Blockchain Academy will tell you that NFTs are exciting because they're decentralized. Keeping track of ownership is out of the hands of the big banks and now the community maintained ledger is in charge! What they gloss over (or neglect to understand) is that the blockchain part isn't what makes NFTs decentralized, it's what makes NFTs about ownership. Information on the internet is decentralized all the time. If you read Riley Shahar's recent piece in the <em>Quest</em>, "'Protocols, Not Platforms': A Mantra For The (We Can Only Hope) Post-Twitter Internet," you should be familiar with the myriad methods of decentralization that protocols can provide. All NFTs do is tell you who "owns" the token (the concept of ownership here is just barely meaningful) and makes sure that everyone on the ledger agrees on who that owner is. Finally, the Zuccs of the world have a way of enshrining ownership and capital in the digital world that had for so long subverted such concepts. Ownership, exclusivity, wealth, have moved into the metaverse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is, however, another reason that the metaverse has become so tied up in NFTs and Crypto, and that's because they're all massive scams. Blockchains have huge problems as far as being an actual way of doing money. I could spend a lot of page space with boring details, but at the end of the day, these technologies aren't all that useful to most people, and instead they've become speculative markets and places for grifters to con terminally online libertarians into investing in a digital world that will never exist.  The metaverse is sold to these suckers as what will actually bring value to their digital assets. Once we all start living in the "web 3.0," they're told their stupid monkey pictures will be a hot commodity. In reality, we have no need for decentralized digital ownership. If the NFT gospel of the metaverse is fake, then all who invest in it are pouring their money into the hands of shameless grifters. If it's true, then the concept of ownership the internet was meant to escape comes crawling back into it. What worries me is not the latter scenario coming true, but that so many people are willing to kiss their money goodbye on the off chance that doing so will bring it about.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Tuesday, October 4, at approximately 8 PM, Harper Egginton ‘25 left their dorm room in Foster to visit a friend over in Scholz. Less than five minutes later, the fire alarm blared in both buildings, sending everyone out to the Great Lawn. Egginton went back inside, finding the hallway filled with smoke and fire extinguisher exhaust. By then they knew the fire had been in their room.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Egginton spoke with the <em>Quest</em><em> </em>about the incident and the response from Reed’s relevant departments, namely Facilities Services, the CSOs, and Student Life. Egginton admitted that the cause of the fire was an accident on their part. They believed they had completely extinguished a burning candle that was set on their dresser, but they had not. The fire started after they had left their room, but Eggington told the <em>Quest</em><em> </em>that they believed the still-hot wick may have broken off and landed on a tablecloth that covered the dresser, which promptly caught fire. While Egginton was in Scholz,&nbsp; three of their floormates noticed the smoke (the hallway smoke detector also went off) and put out the fire with a fire extinguisher. Thankfully, Egginton’s room was unlocked, so their floormates could enter, but the smoke detector inside Egginton’s room did not go off, and neither did the sprinkler.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roughly 15 minutes after the fire alarm sounded, the fire department arrived to assess the damage. The firefighters spoke with Egginton briefly, instructing them to help document the affected possessions within the room, as well as retrieving must-have items, as Egginton was not going to be able to use the room for several days. Firefighters also spoke with Egginton’s HA, as well as two newly-hired CSOs, who arrived at the scene well after the fire department, and, according to Egginton, did not provide any useful instructions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Facilities provided Egginton with a room for the night, but allegedly instructions were otherwise slow to arrive, or simply nonexistent. The CSOs who arrived at the scene requested Egginton’s phone number, explaining that they were to receive a call with further instructions later on. This was not the case, though, as they were never called back. The following day, Egginton went back to their room to retrieve more belongings. The dresser had to be disposed of, as well as the other items damaged by the flames themselves. Facilities had entered the room the night before to conduct some preliminary cleaning, and to take much of Egginton’s possession to be cleaned. They were told to retrieve their belongings later, the following day. Egginton visited the warehouse, where they were instructed to retrieve their belongings, but no one arrived, forcing them to go to 28 West for assistance, where several Student Life employees had to be contacted in order for many of Egginton’s possessions to be returned. Facilities also had left boxes outside Egginton’s door, but did not provide instructions for what to do with them. Egginton was later told that they were supposed to use the boxes to move their belongings, despite the fact that Facilities had already taken many of their belongings away.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Egginton also told the <em>Quest</em><em> </em>that Facilities did not clean out their room to the extent that they were told to expect. Egginton claimed that there was a hole in the wall that had been there indefinitely, that had been filled, but otherwise the cleaning job was haphazard and rushed. All of Egginton’s possessions had to be cleaned of both ash and extinguisher exhaust, and they were forced to do almost all of it themselves despite specific instructions to let Facilities take care of all of it. Overall, Egginton found Facilities to be very challenging to communicate with, as they provided them with inaccurate instructions and often did not respond to their emails asking for assistance or clarification.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Egginton also told the <em>Quest</em><em> </em>that, later on, they received a fine from a Dean of Student Life for, in their words, “endangering the building with an open flame,” among other, non-related grievances. Egginton has moved to schedule a meeting with Dr. Karnell McConnell-Black, the Vice President of Student Life, but according to Egginton, McConnell-Black has not yet responded to their request to schedule a meeting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to get more insight into protocol and response to instances like this, the <em>Quest</em> spoke with Director of Facilities Operations Steve Yeadon. In terms of dorm building protocol, when a fire is detected by the monitoring system, a local alarm sounds for evacuation. According to Yeadon, a 3rd party company monitors the system 24/7, and, in the event of a fire, they contact Community Safety, who then immediately responds to the alarm to verify it is not a false alarm. If not, they contact 911/the fire department and then Facilities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In response to the fact that sprinklers were not triggered in this instance, Facilities wrote that “the system effectively triggers the smoke detector in the room, resulting in an alarm of the system. The building evacuated and our monitoring service notified CS...who then immediately responded to the building. Smoke detection does not trigger the sprinklers...there was not enough heat from the fire, as it was too small to break the fusible link on the sprinklers which is exactly as we would expect the system to work. The detection monitoring system in FSM worked as we would expect and is continually tested, repaired to maintain confidence and state/national compliance.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As for levels of training for those who respond to these instances, Yeadon was only able to speak about Facilities’ role in the matter, but said that, “Facilities conducts in-house training for our technicians. I assume CS conducts their own training.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Concerning items possibly damaged by fire; “Facilities will remove any hazardous items...burned, damaged or contaminated materials. Personal items, such as in the case of a dorm room, will be packaged by the owner. (we provide the boxes and assistance with disposal/removal) Facilities will then work to effect repairs to any building physical damage as quickly as possible. We also arrange to replace any damaged dorm furniture.”In response to Eggington’s negative experience, Yeadon said, “I believe Facilities reached out to the student several times during this event/clean up.” He continued, “We have a responsibility to effect repairs and clean up the area as quickly as possible for both the occupant of the room as well as the other community members. Our goal is to keep residents safe and comfortable in their space as best we can without too much intrusion. Sometimes it's difficult to accomplish this given timing and the constraints of safety and compliance that we have to work within.” Additionally, in Yeadon’s opinion, response to this instance was typical and adequate. “I must say that, from my perspective, the response of CS, the fire department and Facilities went according to our planning and expectations. As it was, this was a small fire that could have been much worse but for the speedy response of all parties.”</p>

<p><em>College Finds No Violation Of Policy; Currie Attributes </em><em>Bigoted Comments </em><em>To Insomnia Medication</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Professor of Psychology Paul Currie has resigned from his position at Reed College, effective January 6, 2023. Currie was filmed in March harassing local food-service workers with racial epithets, sparking multiple days of protests and calls for his removal by students and faculty; his resignation came after “a faculty committee investigated the incident and found no violation of college policy.” In a public statement, Currie attributed his actions to “a well-documented side effect” of prescribed insomnia medication.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reed College President Audrey Bilger announced the conclusions of the Investigating Committee (IC) and Currie’s resignation to the Reed community on the evening of Wednesday, November 30. In her public statement, Bilger said that Currie chose to resign after she “discussed the committee’s findings” with him and with “legal experts.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an email to the <em>Quest</em>, President Bilger said that “all elements” of the investigation into Paul Currie’s actions must remain confidential as a consequence of being “a personnel matter.” Bilger declined to answer questions about the timeline, scope, content, charges, and conclusions of the investigation. When asked if there were any conditions to Currie’s resignation (and if so, what those conditions were), Bilger replied, “We have said everything we can about the conditions of his departure.” Bilger declined to answer questions about the discussions with Currie and “legal experts” that took place.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since March, President Bilger has been criticized by students and faculty for not providing a timeline or any other details about the investigation to the Reed community. However, in her email, Bilger emphasized the importance of obeying confidentiality proper procedure, writing, “It was important to follow Reed’s faculty personnel practices, as these are designed to support our educational program and provide fair employment practices. Shortcuts would have undermined faith in the fairness of the proceedings.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Since coming to Reed, my priority has been and remains to support students in their educational pursuits, efforts that rely on an inclusive and welcoming campus environment,” said Bilger, before emphasizing her responsibility as President “to guide this work forward,” and her personal investment “in building a campus environment where all can thrive.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a statement released to multiple Portland newspapers and provided to the <em>Quest</em>, Currie thanked the IC “for its thorough review of the facts and ultimately concluding I did not violate Reed College's Policy or the Faculty Constitution.” The full statement is available on Page 3 of the <em>Quest</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wrote Currie in the statement, “I’ve been living with intense shame and regret from an event I - still to this day – do not remember.” Currie claimed that he suffers from acute insomnia, and that his behavior in the March video was the result of “a well-documented side effect of a popular medication to treat acute insomnia” prescribed to him by his physician. Currie later clarified that the side effect depicted in the video was “complex sleep behavior.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“My history with acute insomnia was shared with the IC, which I believe led to their decision and recommendation to the president that Reed College had no cause to suspend or terminate my academic tenure, or to impose any other penalty,” said Currie. However, he noted, “There is no excuse to ever engage in offensive or discriminatory behavior and I accept full responsibility for my actions.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When asked about the accuracy of Currie’s claims, President Bilger stated that the college is legally bound not to share employee health information.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the now-infamous video, Currie complains of “rude behavior” from employees at a drive-thru, baselessly accuses the establishment of “hiring illegal immigrants,” and repeatedly asks an employee where she was born and if she was born in the United States. Currie, who is seen at the wheel of his motor vehicle in the drive-thru lane, appears disoriented and slurs his speech.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the state of Oregon, Driving Under the Influence of Intoxicants (including controlled substances) is a misdemeanor crime which carries a maximum prison sentence of 1 year and fines of up to $6,250 on first offense. The statute of limitations for Driving Under the Influence of Intoxicants is 2 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to one article on the subject Complex Sleep Behaviors (CSBs) are “complex activities, normally associated with wakefulness, that occur when the subject is in a sleep-like state after taking a hypnosedative drug.” Individuals typically retain no memory of their CSBs. They are a rare but widely-publicized side effect of nonbenzodiazepine drugs, most notably zolpidem (Ambien), which is one of the most popular sleep aids in the United States. Ambien is, in rare cases, known to cause people to cook, eat, make phone calls, converse, or even have sex while partially or fully unconscious, even at prescribed dosages. “Sleep-driving” is a particularly dangerous CSB that can be caused by the drug. According to the FDA, zolpidem may also cause unusual behavior or decrease inhibition (similar to alcohol), leading to uncharacteristic aggression and extroversion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Attempts to use the side effects of zolpidem as a defense in court against crimes committed while under its influence (such as DUIs) have seen mixed success. The “Ambien Defense,” as it is colloquially known, has been successfully used to defeat or lower charges, but courts may also find individuals liable in cases where they voluntarily intoxicated themselves with a drug whose side effects they were aware of. In 2018, actress Roseanne Barr used the Ambien defense after she made a series of offensive and racist tweets that led to the cancellation of her TV show; following this, Ambien manufacturer Sanofi tweeted, “While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his statement to the <em>Oregonian</em>, Currie emphasized his “decades-long commitment to students’ diversity and inclusivity,” which is “personal” to him as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. He encouraged people to, “continue to support and revere the positive role DEI plays in psychology, neuroscience, and other college-wide curricula,” and expressed hope “that we appreciate how DEI contributes to the overall character and openness of the Reed College community.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When asked for comment by the <em>Quest</em>, Currie wrote, “I'm working to move on to the next chapter in my life and have nothing further to add.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a message to the student body in SB Info, Student Body President Safi Zenger celebrated Currie’s resignation, stating that it “proves that we made an impact in our protests, we made it clear that he was not welcome here, and he took the hint.” After the discovery of the video of Currie in March, students staged multiple days of protests in Eliot Hall and elsewhere on campus calling for his removal and for systemic change at the college. When asked what effect the student protests might have had on the investigation, Bilger declined to answer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Zenger also said that the IC’s determination that he did not violate college policy was “incredibly upsetting” and “emblematic of a much deeper problem” at Reed, writing “our policies have failed us, and spectacularly so at that.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“White supremacy is in the very fabric of this institution, and as much as Reed likes to present a facade of progress and positive change, it’s difficult to feel reassured in moments like these. Especially when understanding that Paul Curie is not the only one of his kind,” Zenger said. “It’s okay to be angry, and this doesn’t have to be the end.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zenger noted that, while there aren’t any solid plans at this time to amend college policies, Dean of Faculty Kathy Oleson recently expressed a desire for there to be student involvement in any Reed policy changes. Said Zenger, “As a senate, we are going to keep pushing for policy changes and student involvement.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When asked if the college had any plans to amend its policies, President Bilger wrote, “Faculty personnel policies are adopted by the faculty and approved by the board of trustees. As noted in our anti-racism statement, we must continually examine our policies to ensure they are equitable.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following Currie’s resignation, psychology and neuroscience majors received an email from Psychology Chair Kris Anderson and Neuroscience Chair Michael Pitts which asserted that they are “working to minimize” disruptions resulting from Currie’s resignation. Said the email, “Faculty will work with Paul’s former students as they finish their programs, and we are requesting a visiting position in behavioral neuroscience to bridge the gap between an anticipated request for a tenure track position in this area.” The two professors also emphasized that Currie’s remarks “do not represent our department’s values or the views of individual faculty members” and called attention to a number of steps which the department has taken this year alone “to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion within our department.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bilger informed the <em>Quest</em><em> </em>of some steps Reed has taken this year to support marginalized students at Reed. She noted that the college now requires new employees to complete bias training, and praised the faculty’s decision to approve Curricular Practical Training for international students, a policy change she noted was “recommended by students.” She also referred to a December 6 communication, sent in conjunction with Vice President And Dean For Institutional Diversity Phyllis Esposito, which pointed out that the College has “Met with joint Committees on Diversity,” “Invested in programs that support diverse communities,” and “Developed administrative divisional DEI plans.” The statement emphasized the need to“continually examine our policies” as well as the importance of community involvement in “intentional organizational change.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The faculty at large has expressed interest in the College’s response to Currie’s actions. In March, 50 faculty signed a letter calling for investigation into his actions and, potentially, his separation from Reed. During every faculty meeting held this semester, Bilger has used part of her President’s Report to provide terse, vague updates on the investigation, and some faculty have expressed dissatisfaction with the transparency of the investigation. “I don’t ask the administration to explain word after word exactly what is going on,” said Professor of Spanish Diego Alonso during an October 10 faculty meeting, “but, in general terms, I expect more clarity.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These regular updates were provided once again during this week’s December 5 faculty meeting; although the President’s Report was given in a closed session which the <em>Quest</em><em> </em>was not allowed to observe, multiple professors in attendance have confirmed that Bilger solicited questions from Faculty about the investigation into Currie’s actions, though her ability to speak on the issue was limited. Allegedly, Bilger was unable to answer most of the questions the faculty asked her.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the Faculty Rules of Procedure, to commence proceedings against a member of the faculty where suspension or termination of tenure is at stake, either the Dean of Faculty or the Committee on Advancement and Tenure (CAT) must present formal charges to a “Committee on Tenure” (COT), which is comprised primarily of members of the pre-existing Appeals and Review committee. Whoever presents the charges bears the burden of proof to satisfy them, and that burden “will be satisfied only by clear and convincing evidence in the record considered as a whole.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once the charges have been presented, COT appoints five tenured faculty to a <em>separate</em><em> </em>Investigating Committee (IC), which investigates the charges. The IC “normally” takes thirty or fewer working days to conclude its investigation, and ultimately votes on the charges via “secret ballot.” Once they’ve voted, they deliver a report of their findings and recommendations to the President, who either accepts or rejects them. The President of the College is permitted to attend any hearings or meetings held by the IC or COT as an observer.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The IC may recommend in favor of or against termination or suspension based on their findings. The IC may find that a faculty-member did, in fact, violate college policy but nevertheless conclude that there is not adequate cause for suspension or termination, <em>or</em><em> </em>they may simply choose to recommend against those sanctions despite having cause to impose them. However, in Currie’s case, the IC specifically found that there was<em> </em><em>no violation</em> of college policy, and President Bilger accepted these findings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s not clear how much time passed between the conclusion of the investigation and Currie’s resignation. However, Bilger emphasized that, once Currie agreed to resign, she informed the community of his decision “immediately” after it was finalized due to her desire to provide a concrete update on the situation, despite the poor timing of the announcement.&nbsp;In a statement to the <em>Quest, </em>Bilger wrote, “I am grateful to all who have worked to advance inclusion and who continue to devote their time and energy to cultivating a welcoming environment. We must collectively engage in this work to make changes that strengthen our community, and my senior leadership team and I are dedicated to supporting our Reed community and ensuring students can thrive as they pursue their educational goals.”</p>

		<title><![CDATA[HCC How-to: Prescription Procedure]]></title>
		<link>https://reedquest.org/2023/02/01/hcc-how-to-prescription-procedure/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*All students in this article are anonymized to protect medical privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recently, the<em> </em><em>Quest</em> was approached by some concerned students regarding the state of the HCC’s mental health resources, specifically when handling prescription drugs. We reached out to the HCC and asked other students about their experiences. How accessible is the HCC? What does the process of obtaining prescription drugs look like?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Students can use the health portal to schedule appointments for depression and/or anxiety medication consultations. As Dr. Timothie Rochon explains over an email interview with the<em> Quest</em>, “all of the providers follow diagnostic and treatment guidelines'' and “follow-up visits are done with students.” A student described the process as “straightforward” and received the prescription for hydroxyzine to manage their anxiety in the same appointment without any formal diagnosis. Another student related filling out a form describing their symptoms before being suggested a few different prescriptions some days later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One student expressed concern over their friends not being adequately informed of their medication, often consulting them or the internet for answers. Another student remarked that “in hindsight I think my provider at the HCC should have done more to refer me to a psychologist / psychiatrist/other counseling services for a proper diagnosis process, as opposed to just slapping a bandaid on my anxiety symptoms” and was later diagnosed with ADHD as the root of their anxiety. Students are given medication information such as side effects and instructions and can ask questions during follow-up appointments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When asked about the seemingly large frequency of prescriptions, Director of Counseling Services Johanna Workman wrote that “the number of prescriptions that the HCC has written for controlled medication such as Adderall for ADHD, is less this semester compared to the Fall 2021 semester.” She goes on to write that “it's harder to get a data driven answer” for antidepressant medication “than it is for controlled medication.” However, she notes, “we have improved access over the last two years by adding psychiatric prescribers, and also by&nbsp; providing online scheduling” which may explain some apparent increase in prescriptions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There currently is no case manager at the HCC, who departed last month. As one student noted, this seems to indicate a lack of organization and a greater lack of transparency. Workman explains that “case management duties (such as providing referrals to providers in the community) have continued in their absence, with our Staff Counselors providing case management services. One of our Staff Counselors will be transferring into the Case Manager role full-time on January 3, 2023. This transfer leaves us with one Staff Counselor vacancy, which is currently posted on the Reed job site.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The counseling services that the HCC provides are located on their website—apart from the medication counseling on the student health portal. Students can call 503-777-7281 to schedule an appointment with one of the counselors, but “they are extremely limited and basically any issues further than a stressful week are referred to external providers,” as a student observes. Workman explains that “counselors provide short-term solution focused in-house counseling.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For students who seek long-term therapy, we provide case management services to help students get connected to a provider in the community. In making referrals, we take into account the students' preferences and insurance.”<br>Programs like <em>UWill</em>, which provides online counseling services, and <em>Togetherall</em>, which is described as a “safe online community” for students to interact, are offered beyond the handful of sessions that counselors can provide. Beyond this, students must look off campus for assistance. Reed also offers a 24/7 Crisis Counseling hotline for emergency mental health needs, but students have reportedly had a terrible experience with the service. While it seems that there is a formal procedure for obtaining prescription medication from the HCC, the separation of the counseling services and the prescription services can prove quite limiting for students seeking mental health assistance as it emphasizes one type of treatment over the other. There is no correct solution to handling mental health issues, but utilizing a wide range of techniques helps individuals by allowing them to explore other options that may work for them.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sparsely-attended December 5th faculty meeting included updates about the proceedings of the Office of Institutional Diversity (OID), information from Student Life regarding student care resources, as well as end-of-semester reminders from the Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) and the Associate Dean of Faculty. Upon President Audrey Bilger’s commencement of the meeting, a vote was taken to move into executive session in order to discuss confidential matters. The <em>Quest</em> was not present during this session, as it was exclusive to faculty and relevant members of staff, but anonymous sources have alleged that the discussion centered around Paul Currie’s recent resignation following an investigation that showed no violation of policy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the executive session was completed and the regular faculty meeting resumed, President Bilger called on Phyllis Esposito, Vice President and Dean of Institutional Diversity, to provide updates on behalf of OID. Esposito announced that a webpage entitled “Where We Stand” was being updated to include the recent actions taken regarding the office’s 2022 commitments. This webpage had been created to make communications about OID’s progress and plans more visible and open in order to invite conversations about the office’s role on campus. Esposito went on to note that multiple positions within the office are currently being hired for, as the Staffing Associate to OID had received 34 applications and the Associate to the Dean of OID had received 20 applications. As these applications get reviewed, Esposito shared plans to onboard these new hires, generate divisional plans, and maintain transparency about actions within OID. Moreover, Esposito stated that OID had plans to go on a retreat in order to ideate and plan OID’s goals and mission. Esposito closed her report by mentioning that the faculty and staff campus climate survey had been open and received 160 respondents, and she encouraged faculty and staff to include their voices in the survey. She stressed that the survey was confidential and outsourced to a different body, and the information from this survey would help OID make decisions to best serve campus groups.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Karnell McConnell-Black, Vice President and Dean of Student Life, provided updates on student support and care. He noted that an unusual number of students had been receiving care referrals and taking leaves of absence, and many students had been coming to the Student Life Office with concerns surrounding how mental health and stress were taking a toll on their lives. Student Life has been working on individual solutions to best suit individual students’ needs, whether that be taking a leave, receiving an incomplete, or getting connected to appropriate resources. McConnell-Black stated that Student Life staff has been spending the vast majority of their time and energy working directly with students to navigate individual concerns. He then encouraged faculty to feel free to reach out to Student Life staff with any questions, whether that be with insight about how students are feeling, or with efforts to better collaborate with Student Life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mary Ashburn Miller, Professor of History and Humanities, then spoke on behalf of the Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL). Her report began with the theme of gratitude, as she requested that every member of the meeting shout out the name of an individual that helped them become a better person in the classroom. In line with this expression of gratitude, Miller thanked the 12 attendees of the Advising Workshop, the 8 attendees of the Inclusive Pedagogy and Teaching Workshop, the 4 members of the CTL Reading Group, and the 9 faculty working in the Student-Teaching Consulting Program for their commitment to engagement in the classroom. Miller went on to invite all faculty members to work with CTL in the spring semester by attending workshops, participating in or recruiting students for the Student-Teaching Consulting Program, or joining the CTL Reading Group, which will be reading bell hooks’ “Teaching Community: A Pedagogy of Hope.” More immediately, Miller also encouraged faculty to come together in the CTL office on the Thursday of exam week to grade in community. Miller also noted that faculty members can look forward to Paideia events, including the annual syllabus exchange and the embodied pedagogy workshop. As a final reminder, Miller also noted that syllabus revision resources would be available come January, and she suggested that faculty consider asking students to annotate syllabi at the end of the semester as a tool for future syllabus revisions. Miller rounded out her report with her monthly tidbit, where she asked faculty to consider how to pivot the focus of the end of the semester away from “summative assessments,” and instead toward “formative assessments,” allowing faculty members to consider how they’ve grown and how further improvements can be made.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In line with Miller’s end-of-semester ideas for consideration, Associate Dean of Faculty and Associate Professor of Political Science and Humanities, Tamara Metz reported on key parts of the faculty code that could be relevant to the upcoming final exam week. Metz first noted that final exams should be scheduled for a period between one and four hours, regardless of whether the exam is in-person or take-home. After a question from a faculty member, Metz clarified that this does preclude untimed finals. Metz then brought up a part of the code that she had recently discovered, which provides a recommended distribution of grades across a class, such that 25 percent of students would receive As, 45 percent of students would receive Bs, 25 percent of students would receive Cs, and 5 percent of students would receive Ds. The final reminder that Metz provided was that the faculty code does not allow work to be assigned over fall, spring, or winter break, inclusive of work due within the first week of return to classes, unless with a prior announcement in the course syllabus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rest of Metz’s report as the Associate Dean of Faculty included updates on committees, a research showcase, and a congratulatory note. Metz stated that she and Kathy Oleson, Dean of Faculty, would be initiating an audit of faculty committees in order to optimize practice and revise inefficiencies. She also noted that the Academic Success Committee had been focusing on reworking the faculty advising system, and they had collected data to find a common mission and goal. The committee identified two key issues to be addressed in early spring, namely the timing of new student advising and registration, as well as unifying how 4 and 8-week comments are to be used. Metz then invited the faculty to a December 13 faculty research showcase, in which Matt Pearson, Professor of Linguistics, and Yalçin Özkan, Visiting Assistant Professor of Sociology, would be presenting quick, eight-minute presentations. Metz also stated that there was a free spot in the showcase, and any faculty members with an eight-minute presentation in their back pocket were free to take it. Lastly, Metz congratulated 34 new faculty members, 10 of whom are tenure-track professors, for completing their first semesters at Reed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During Metz’s report, a faculty member raised a question regarding the campus climate survey conducted in early 2022 with Tony Boston, the former interim Vice President and Dean of Institutional Diversity. The faculty member asked if the Student Success Committee was still working on processing that data, or if faculty members had access to that information. They stated, “We’re good at generating data. Some of us want to use it.” President Bilger responded, stating that the team was still sifting through the data alongside Institutional Research, and the data was not yet available to faculty. Bilger also noted that to reduce the endeavor's complexity, the committee had begun working with an outside provider for future campus climate surveys.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jolina Kwong Caputo, Associate to the Dean of Faculty, made an announcement representing the Paid Leave Oregon Working Group. She noted that beginning January 1, 2023, a new 0.6 percent tax would be implemented. She went on to say that in September 2023, faculty would be able to receive paid leave for birth, sexual assault, harassment, stalking, and other events. Caputo stated that more information would be available in the coming year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kara Cerveny, Chair of the Committee of Academic Policy Planning (CAPP), then began to provide committee updates. However, Cerveny was quickly stopped by a question asking what the meeting’s quorum was. A quorum was determined at 59, and after a few rounds of mental math, followed by a verbal counting off of every voting member in the room, the number of voting members was found to be 54, just a few members short of having quorum. At this point, the meeting was temporarily adjourned so individuals could search Vollum for faculty available to attend the meeting as voting members. This search was fruitless. Thus, the faculty meeting was adjourned, and all remaining agenda items were pushed to the next month’s meeting.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I can feel the bite of this morning’s incident still coursing through my veins. I had been walking to class, minding my own business when a huge black dog came racing around the corner and sunk its teeth into me before Professor Goldie could even say “Down!” The professor was apologetic, but it seemed more like an afterthought than genuine concern – she then started crying uncontrollably. She made me promise that I wouldn’t tell a soul that her dog has bitten me, because if I do, “They’ll find out.” It certainly wasn't what I expected from her office hours today, as if things weren’t weird enough already. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In shock, I did my best to patch up myself with whatever odds and ends were lying around until eventually making it home whereupon further scrutiny revealed that yes, indeed: Professor Goldie's dog had bitten me in the leg. I couldn't check on the wound sooner because I had become preoccupied by an apparition. As I made my way past the library, I made a turn under the rain canopy to find the ghost of regimes past; Richard Nixon proceeded to chase me across campus screaming something about 'cover-ups.' It sounded alarming at first, but once we got back to the language villa, he settled down long enough for us to get acquainted over some tea (black). I think the international atmosphere made him a bit worried about his behavior, and he quickly collected his thoughts (can ghosts have thoughts?). He told stories of White House visitors who would come in dressed as ghosts just so they wouldn't have their photos taken by reporters camped out on his lawn every day – well you learn something new every day don't ya? But now here we are back on solid ground ... or asphalt, rather. I remember asking Mr. Nixon if he knew of any remedies for dog bites, to which he simply replied, "The finest steel has to go through the hottest fire." Maybe he was flirting with me?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For days after the bite-and-chase incident, all bets were off while friends tried various remedies ranging from special ointments made in Provence to boiled witches' brews found deep beneath Parisian cobblestones – almost anything except actually visiting the HCC because let's be real, no one has time for that, amirite? I'd much rather just bite the bullet and get an infection. Mercifully though, things started to take a turn for the better once my dear friend Audrey arrived with a box full of homemade healing crystals which didn't work exactly how advertised (it took several weeks for them fully activate) BUT miracle upon miracle, suddenly there was only the faintest trace of Professor Goldie's dog's bite remaining. My wound disappeared as quickly as a stoner's smoke rings through 1970s London fog – I was left without any lingering evidence from this caper gone awry. Therein lies the moral, I believe: sometimes life takes unexpected turns yet ultimately painful memories dissipate faster than the most fleeting of moments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And so, I stand before you today with a greater understanding of life’s impermanence and a newfound appreciation for the importance of resilience in the face of adversity. The greatest takeaway from this experience is that no matter what obstacles may arise, with a bit of perseverance and a positive outlook, it is possible to come out on the other side unscathed. So, I urge you all to remember this lesson – always aim high, never forget your dreams, and remain steadfast &amp; resilient against winds conspiring otherwise.</p>

<p>Reed Students, Faculty, and Staff:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you may have read or heard, I am leaving my teaching position at Reed College effective January 6, 2023. I want to thank the investigating committee (IC) for its thorough review of the facts and ultimately concluding I did not violate Reed College's Policy or the Faculty Constitution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the last few months, I’ve been living with intense shame and regret from an event I - still to this day – do not remember. There is no excuse to ever engage in offensive or discriminatory behavior and I accept full responsibility for my actions. Out of respect to my colleagues and students, I would like to share that the incident in question stemmed from a well-documented side effect of a popular medication to treat acute insomnia. My history with acute insomnia was shared with the IC, which I believe led to their decision and recommendation to the president that Reed College had no cause to suspend or terminate my academic tenure, or to impose any other penalty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The recorded video shared on social media depicts complex sleep behavior caused by a medication prescribed by my physician. What it does not show is my decades-long commitment to students’ diversity and inclusivity, which dates to my time as a graduate student and then a postdoctoral fellow. As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, helping students from marginalized groups is personal for me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those who know me well, I hope you will consider our relationship and my work in the realm of DEI – one that involved helping students feel safe and included, in the classroom and research laboratory. For others, I hope you will continue to support and revere the positive role DEI plays in psychology, neuroscience, and other college-wide curricula. My ﬁnal hope is that we appreciate how DEI contributes to the overall character and openness of the Reed College community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Warm regards,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paul Currie, Ph.D.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Monday, January 23</strong></h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>0130; Cannabis Use or Possession; Naito Hall</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“CSOs encountered the odor of cannabis while on patrol near Naito hall. The CSOs observed two students leaning out of an open window in Naito hall and passing back and forth what looked to be a cannabis joint. The CSOs alerted the students to their presence and then went to the residence to speak directly with the students. The students confirmed that they were smoking cannabis and stated that they were aware that cannabis use on Reed property is against Reed policy and were apologetic. The CSOs then continued on their patrol.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Hey, at least you opened the window. Please keep opening the window. We, and the smoke saturated carpets, thank you.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>0656; Suspicious Person/Activity/Circumstances/Exclusion; Medical Office North</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A CSO on patrol of the Medical Offices encountered an individual camping outside one of the entrances to the building. The individual declined to respond or move elsewhere to sleep after multiple requests from the CSO. The CSO then requested Portland Police assistance. A second CSO arrived, and approximately 30 minutes later, the individual got up. The first CSO then recognized the individual as someone who had been escorted off campus in prior interactions. The CSO formally excluded the individual and escorted them off of Reed property.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Sleeping must be everyone’s new year's resolution.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;0835; Theft of Motor Vehicle/Clery Act Reportable Incident; Grove Lot</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A student reported that their vehicle had been stolen from where it was parked in the Grove lot. The student was already in contact with Portland Police to report the theft.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>That’s horrible! We hope you get your car back soon!</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1049; Theft - Other; Trillium</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A CSO responded to a report of theft from Trillium residence hall. The CSO met with a student who stated that their box drum had been stolen while it had been left in the print room over winter break. The CSO advised the student to file a police report, but to also entertain the assumption that it may have been taken by another student who didn’t realize it was a specific person’s personal property and to put up some flyers requesting the return of their drum.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Impressive honestly, of all the thefts you could commit, stealthily moving a giant box drum seems like the most work for the least reward. But also, give it back, taking other peoples’ drums isn’t nice :(</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tuesday, January 24</strong></h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>0255; Damage to Property; Grove Lot</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“CSOs on vehicle patrol in the Grove Lot encountered a black BMW sedan parked and running near the gravel road on the north side of the lot. The sedan drove out of the parking lot quickly after being passed by the CS vehicle. The CSOs then inspected the immediate area and found that a vehicle parked in the lot had been the subject of an attempted break-in. On the ground they found a drill bit that had been used to drill out the keyhole in the driver side lock, along with a piece of the lock that had been removed. The vehicle is registered with Community Safety so the owner was able to be contacted regarding the damage.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Oh no! We hope your car can be fixed and good as new soon.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Thursday, January 26</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>0024; Suspicious Person/Activity/Circumstances; Student Union</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“CSOs conducting a lock up of the Student Union encountered an unknown individual sleeping on a sofa inside the building. When the CSOs asked if the person was a current student, they replied that they were an alum. When the CSOs requested the person verify their identity, the individual said that they would just leave. The CSOs advised the individual that unless they had a community member escort or proof that they were an alum, they would be unable to continue sleeping on campus and would have to leave. The individual exited the building and the CSOs followed them to ensure they left campus.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Sometimes you just gotta sleep where you are.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>0516; Suspicious Person/Activity/Circumstances; West Lot</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A CSO on patrol in the West lot encountered a vehicle parked near the dumpsters with its trunk open. This vehicle appeared to be the same vehicle that, two days prior, had been parked with its trunk open near the dumpsters in the Grove lot. In the first encounter, when asked what their business was at Reed, the driver and a second vehicle occupant gave conflicting answers and left quickly after. The CSO was unable to make contact with the vehicle driver or occupant in the second encounter. In both instances, when CSOs inspected the immediate area nothing suspicious was observed.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>C’mon guys, if you’re going to steal, at least get your story straight.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Friday, January 27</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>0251; Evidence of Drug Use; GCC/Pool Hall</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“CSOs encountered the odor of cannabis while patrolling the lower level of the GCC. After a short search of the vicinity, the CSOs determined that the source of the odor was the remaining portion of a burnt cannabis joint located in an ashtray in the Pool Hall manager’s office.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1140; Suspicious Person/Activity/Circumstances; GCC/Bookstore</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“CSOs responded to a report of possible theft from the bookstore. After speaking with a bookstore employee, the CSOs searched the area in an attempt to locate the individual described by the bookstore employee. The CSOs located the individual inside the Student Union. It became apparent that the individual was experiencing a mental health crisis but was cooperative when asked to leave campus. The CSOs did not issue a formal exclusion as they did not believe it would have been comprehended meaningfully by the individual.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2127; Cannabis Use or Possession; Sports Field</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A CSO encountered the odor of cannabis while enroute to Naito hall. The CSO observed an individual smoking something while sitting on the Sports Field bleachers. The CSO approached the individual, who confirmed they were a Reed student. Initially the student stated that they were not smoking cannabis, however the CSO observed that the student was still holding the remainder of a smoking cannabis joint. The student apologized and said they would stop smoking it on campus.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>At least you tried to lie? Better luck next time.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Saturday, January 28</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>0352; Damage to Property; Grove Lot</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A CSO on vehicle patrol in the Grove lot encountered an all black Hyundai Elantra with a “Tonkin” plate and no temporary tags parked but running in the middle of the driveway of the lot. When the CSO attempted to make contact with the vehicle driver, an unknown individual entered the vehicle and drove out of the lot. Still in the CS Vehicle, the CSO followed the vehicle out of the lot. The CSO then turned left onto 28th Avenue. The CSO then observed that the vehicle that had left the lot executed a U-turn in the road, turned their headlights off, then accelerated quickly coming up behind the CS vehicle. The CSO prepared to turn left into the 28 West parking lot. As they did so, the other vehicle continued to accelerate and, according to the observations of another CSO, came extremely close to hitting the CS vehicle. The CSO then returned to the parking lot to investigate the area at which the vehicle had originally been parked. There, the CSO observed that the same vehicle that had been damaged in a prior attempted break-in, report #230032, again showed evidence that an attempt had been made to drill the lock out of the driver side door.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>That is horrible! Pls stop trying to steal peoples’ cars, especially if you suck at it.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Sunday, January 29</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>0135; Medical Assist - Alcohol; Residence Hall</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“CSOs responded to a request for medical assistance in a residence hall. They met with the reporting party who expressed concern for their friend who had consumed multiple alcoholic drinks and had become sick. The CSOs made contact with the intoxicated student, who confirmed that they had felt sick but that they did not require any medical intervention. The CSOs remained on scene for a little while to evaluate the student for any signs of alcohol or other drug overdose. After confirming that the student was feeling better and had friends that they would be staying with, the CSOs cleared from the call.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Glad you were feeling okay! Don’t party too hard guys.</em></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In late July 2013, two agents of the British intelligence services entered the headquarters of the <em>Guardian</em> newspaper in London. Under their watchful eye, three <em>Guardian</em> journalists reluctantly armed themselves with power drills and proceeded to, at the order of the British government, destroy beyond recognition the circuit boards, disks, and external hard drives that had once contained the Snowden files. To those who witnessed the destruction of the drives, including former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger, the scene was “chilling — reminiscent of burned books.” And indeed, it was a book burning, if of a peculiar sort. The Snowden archives were massive, likely containing enough data to fill hundreds if not thousands of printed books if ever committed to paper. When those drills began to cut into circuits, an entire library burned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Luckily, they just made a copy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s the thing about information, especially digital information: no matter how hard you try, it’s very hard to kill. As a “digital native” I’ve seen that first hand — I spent middle school watching teacher after teacher desperately try (and fail) to play whackamole with Sparknotes users, and, less humorously, I spent high school watching Donald Trump’s Big Lie spread through the internet like wildfire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet even after all I saw, when adults tried to tell me to fear the digital world — pointing out the dangers of the “dark web” and social media addictions and the much-feared boogeyman of mental health — I never quite believed them. Sure, the web was a big place that occasionally tried to sell me on the “proven existence” of lizard people in the sewers, but nevertheless, all I could feel when I opened a search engine, always ready with a question, was awe. Awe, that I, some random kid from the Michigan suburbs, could ask any question, and the world would answer. Awe, that such a vast sea of knowledge, the collected dreaming and wondering and learning of the human race, could be there on the other side of the screen, close enough to touch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newspapers of the 20th century were born in a time of information scarcity, when it was both physically and economically hard to find things out. If you wanted to know how the US was faring in Vietnam, for example, the best way to go about it was to get some people together, give them a camera and maybe a little training if you had the money, point them at Vietnam, and then trust them to go there and tell you stuff when they got back. But going to Vietnam was expensive, in both blood and treasure, and most people didn’t have the inclination, resources, or skills to do it. So we trained special people to go places and see things, and we called them reporters, and large groups of consumers, mainly newspaper subscribers, put their weekly paper money into a big hat that subsidized the cost for the professionals. (For more on this idea and what follows, check out David Roberts’ “<a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/12/7/18117404/advice-for-journalists-news-media">Advice for Aspiring Explainer Journalists</a>” at Vox).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This worked because most people, informationally speaking, were starving: there wasn’t enough news, and the only way to get it was to pay for it. Is it any wonder, then, that the print newspaper has been so devastated by the digital revolution? In less than a century, we’ve gone from a world in which it took days, if not weeks, for a letter to travel from London to New York, to a world in which I can pull a piece of metal out of my pocket at any time and, in a keystroke or two, learn anything the human race has ever known. We no longer live in an age of information hunger, but information glut — and that poses its own set of problems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first, of course, is that in the informational sea — as in any sea — it is possible to drown. The mere fact that we have so much information does not automatically mean that all of it is easy to make sense of, or even that all of it is reliably true.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a result, the playing field has been suddenly, and some might say apocalyptically, leveled. While it remains expensive to give people cameras and fly them places, nobody is inclined to pay for it because it would be easier to just call someone on the ground, or search Instagram for real-time eyewitness accounts, or build a combat map based on Google Maps traffic-tracking (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22954426/google-disables-maps-traffic-data-in-ukraine-to-protect-citizens">as the Russian army terrifyingly may have done in Ukraine early last year</a>). Journalists, who built an industry on pooling the resources and skills necessary to obtain scarce information, suddenly have to contend with more free and public information than any human being could consume in a single lifetime. As a result, the amateur journalist, or even simply the reader, has access to the exact same live updates and leaked data sets as the professional.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What, then, are the professionals here to do? The answer, I think, lies in the fact that such an information overload implies a much greater need for analysis. A niche has been created for a new type of reporter — call them investigative computer scientists, or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/06/29/dept-of-data/">data journalists</a> — who do for databases what reporters do for sources: help them tell their stories. This is certainly not an easy task, and while it lends itself to the traditional skills of reporting (curiosity, pattern matching, and copious amounts of caffeine), it also blurs the lines between journalism, computer science, and the visual arts. In this column, I’ll bring you stories driven by data, from this week’s deep dive into war in the MCU, to an investigation on campaign finance in the US midterms, to an oddly specific analysis of PDX trees. Some of these stories will be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/">beautiful</a>, others just for fun, and some, I hope, will be thought provoking, but they will all bring the art of data to the fore and, in doing so, offer a new perspective on the stories the <em>Quest</em> covers each week. I hope you’re excited to join me.</p>

<p>Species: Bufflehead, or <em>Bucephala albeola</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Family: Anatidae (waterfowl, i.e., ducks, geese, and swans)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Star sign: Sagittarius</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rating: 15/10</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ideal Date: Zoom call …even though the Bufflehead is too old to have even an ounce of computer literacy</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While plenty of members of the avian kingdom have far greater majesty, elegance, intelligence, and skill than this week’s special friend, there are few who spark as much pure <em>delight</em><em> </em>in the hearts of men as the beguiling Bufflehead. This cute quacker is the smallest diving duck in North America (because of its small size, the resourceful Bufflehead often nests in hollows left behind by Northern Flickers, the only duck dinky enough to do so), but its small stature does nothing to diminish its big personality, which shines through in its striking plumage. In males, the body and the sides of the head are a blinding snow-white, accentuated by shimmering purple-green feathers which encircle the neck and the front of the face. This flashy patterming makes the Bufflehead as easy to spot as it is enjoyable to see. Indeed, a fact sheet published by <em>Hinterland Who’s Who</em> calls the Bufflehead one of the most popular ducks among waterfowl enthusiasts, a bold claim that is nevertheless difficult to argue. Even the name “Bufflehead” — a portmanteau of buffalo-head which refers to the drake’s disproportionately puffed-up head plumage — carries a certain inherent goofy zeal, shared by the likes of shenanigan, rutabaga, and bamboozle.<em> </em><em>It’s just fun to say!</em><em> </em>A suitably whimsical name for this whimsical waterfowl.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Almost without exception, Buffleheads mate in committed monogamous pairs, using a ritual that involves a lot of head bobbing and low fly-overs above the female. Males will leave their partners at the end of the breeding season, but don’t be alarmed, because pairs will often reunite to mate multiple years in a row. Maybe romance isn’t dead, and maybe, if these lovey duckies can make long-distance work, you can too! Not only does this “diminutive diver” have an old-fashioned sense of romance, but the species is just plain old! According to All About Birds, 500,000 year old Bufflehead fossils have been uncovered all across North America, from Florida to California and all the way to Alaska. For reference, the oldest known remains of <em>Homo Sapiens</em> are only 300,000 years old.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thankfully, in the modern day, us young upstart humans haven’t yet managed to outcompete our Pleistocene pal — although the Bufflehead is scarce, it isn’t considered endangered. While some do hunt the birds as game (hunters apparently call them “Butterballs,” which would probably be considered a quirky name for any duck that wasn’t already called the <em>Bufflehead)</em>, they aren’t very popular prey; writes <em>Hinterland Who’s Who, </em>“This is a duck that is more valuable to people as an object of delight than as a hunting statistic.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Buffleheads are infrequent winter visitors to the Reed Canyon, so be sure to keep an eye out for this delightful duck. Males are famously easy to identify — watch for a little duck (smaller than a mallard) with the aforementioned bright white feathers on the body, and in big patches on the side of the head. The back is black, and the patterning around the neck and the center of its face appears dark from a distance, but resolves into blue and purple up close. The head is large, bill is petite, and the feet are pink. Females are a little more difficult: they are primarily brown, with lighter bodies, darker backs and heads, and white patches on the cheeks. Also note that the head is smaller, lacking the fluffy crest of the male. Buffleheads are usually seen alone or in mating pairs, rather than on their own, and will bob quietly on the water’s surface between making frequent, graceful dives below the surface to forage for tasty invertebrates, just as they have for countless centuries. Empires may rise and fall, whole species may be born and die out, the Earth may be swallowed in ice or boiled in heat, but the Bufflehead remains — eternal, undying, and just as cute as ever. To adapt a quote from <em>Hinterland Who’s Wh</em>o: long has this friend brightened the waters of North America, and long may it continue to do so.</p>

<p><em>Photo by Liz Organ</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Just a baby!</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Names: Pippin</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Breed: Havanese</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Age: 6 Months</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rating: 14/10<br>Named after both the son of Charlegmagne (and the musical about his life) and the Lord of the Rings character — two great explorers — Pippin loves to explore new things! He’s a big fan of everything he can sniff and he loves people. Everytime someone would pass by him, Pippin would stare at them until they either got out of eyesight or they came to pet him. He’s incredibly soft and I would absolutely recommend petting him if you get the chance, he’s just a ball of floof! At six months old, he’s also the youngest pup we’ve had on <em>Dog of the Week</em> this year! However, despite being less than 20 lbs, he’s about as big as he’s going to get, which means he’s going to be puppy-sized forever! Pippin has been going to puppy classes and knows how to sit, lie down, and stay, although like most pups, he can be a little mischievous if there is something distracting him like people or a very interesting blade of grass. Right now, he’s not a huge fan of bigger dogs which is understandable! Luckily he’s getting used to them and pretty soon he’ll be the friendliest dog on the block! Just make sure you pet him if you get the chance, especially if you want to know what a live teddy bear feels like!</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Marketplace Drink Tier List]]></title>
		<link>https://reedquest.org/2023/02/03/marketplace-drink-tier-list/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Reed Marketplace is a highly competitive establishment for drinks. With one of the most diverse drink selections in the country, the meta is always changing, with new drinks arriving and replacing old ones constantly. What makes a good drink is its ability to monopolize a niche. For example, water is such a successful drink because it managed to single-handedly monopolize the “quench thirst” niche, while Coke monopolizes the “mixer” niche.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That being said, let’s get into the tier list.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On F tier we have the newly introduced Bubble matcha tea. With a whooping 43g of added sugar and a bright neon green label, it’s closer to a Monster Energy drink than a cute bubble tea. On top of that, the milk content limits its consumers to those who aren’t vegan or lactose intolerant. Also on F tier we have the You Gut This probiotic water, which will never be a popular drink due to being the most expensive drink in the meta with an insane $10 price. This makes other probiotic drinks, which also taste much better, more convenient. Lastly on F tier we have the Pop and Bottle lattes, which I don’t understand who drinks since there are so many better coffee alternatives that don’t taste like chalk.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On E Tier we have the Pobble bubble tea, which falls short on the list due to its poor design that makes it extremely difficult to eat the bubbles. Why would you design a bubble tea into a can? No one wants to drink tea and then tongue the can to get the bubbles out. Two newly introduced drinks—the Evy and Joy milk tea—also fall into E tier simply because they don’t taste good. Evy tried to take over the sweet tea niche but failed miserably, and Joy tastes like whole milk. Finally on E tier we have the Simply lemonade and orange juice, which is the wolf dressed as a sheep of healthy drinks. It tastes good, but it has so much sugar that you’d be better off with a Pressed Juice if health is what you’re going for. And if you’re not going for a healthy drink, why would you pick this one?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On D tier we start off with the apple juices, which I simply don’t like. If I’m craving apples, I’d just have the concerningly large red apples they have next to the drinks. Do you have the slightest runny nose? Are you throwing up blood and have a 103<sup>o</sup> fever? Well the Vive shots heal it all. Yes, it will feel like your throat is on fire, but it’s part of the process! We all know turmeric and ginger do what four covid vaccines could never. Next on the list we have the old fashioned Coke. Portland is way too cold to crave this drink, and because the Yerba Mate and Cold Brew have taken over the “I need caffeine to crank out this paper” niche, Coke has become obsolete in the meta, except when used as a mixer. Lastly, we have the Arizona teas, which are a classic but are falling behind because of better tasting drinks. Sencha Shots try to occupy the “I need energy now I don’t care about the flavor” niche, but it’s tea, who are we kidding. If power is what you’re going for, a redbull or cold brew will work much better.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moving on to C tier we have the infamous Mamma Chia. The texture will either make you love it or hate it. It fills both the “constipation” and the “health” niche, but its texture makes it too controversial to rank it any higher. The San Pellegrino is great in flavor and price, but I strongly dislike carbonated water so I can’t rank it any higher than C tier. Why the bottled Seven tea was replaced for the canned version of it is one of the great mysteries of Reed, but what isn’t a mystery is that it’s not as good anymore, so I have to place it on C tier. It’s still pretty good, but not nearly as good as its bottled version, which is the first drink on B tier. Also on C tier we have the newly introduced Swoon lemonade, which not only has 0g of sugar, it’s also relatively good in flavor. But not good enough to be placed higher than C tier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The famous Yerba Mate has the opposite problem than the Seven tea. The bottled version just tastes worse than the canned version, so I have to place this version on B tier. Mortal Kombucha is proving to be a huge success, but only a particular group of people can stand the flavor of Kombucha, so I can’t place it any higher than B tier. Next up we have the Crisp aloe vera drinks. These drinks are refreshing, tasty, and chewy, however, they have a weird aftertaste and are also pretending to be healthy even though they have double the amount of added sugars than a Yerba Mate.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A tier is only for the highly demanded and competitive drinks. They specialize in a particular niche and don’t try to be anything else. The Pressed Juices occupy the health niche while also managing to taste amazing. They don’t need any monk fruit or flashy labels to attract people. They were so popular that they actually drained a lot of people’s board points, because when you’re paying with monopoly money you tend to not realize they’re almost $6, which is why they’re not in S tier. Next up we have Ito En’s unsweetened tea. This drink is very refreshing and one of the only drinks in the Marketplace that isn’t aggressively sweet. Personally I’d rather drink water but I see the appeal. Next up we have the Yuzus, which are one of the best carbonated drinks in the marketplace. Their peach flavor in particular is quite extraordinary. In fact, it’s so popular it’s one of the first drinks to run out. The cold brews are great morning drinks and are overall well rounded. Not much else to say about them I guess.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And now… we move on to the best drinks. Those who taste the best, serve a purpose in our lives, and to put it simply, are unique. The first apex drink is the Victorian rose lemonade. This lemonade has a floral, perfectly sweet taste. Its carbonation is perfect for a post lab snack when life feels meaningless and you feel absolutely numb and need something to wake you up. Most people can relate with this statement, which is unfortunately why it’s rare nowadays to see this drink. Do you feel angsty and neurotic? Do you also drink Yerba Mate? I have no proof whether this is causation or correlation, but this drink definitely does something to you. It tastes amazing, it makes you feel amazing, and it’s fashionable. You couldn’t ask for anything more, which is why the canned Yerba Mate is the most popular drink on campus competing only with water and milk. </p>

<p><strong>The Summary (Of Events)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In late December, the news outlet Gizmodo <a href="https://gizmodo.com/dnd-open-gaming-license-dungeons-dragons-wizards-coast-1849919823">reported on</a> a leaked document that would soon provoke massive outrage and give the Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D) community – and the whole Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) community at large – its greatest shake up in a long while. The leaks indicated that Wizards of the Coast (WOTC) and Hasbro, the owners and producers of D&amp;D, were attempting to, in Gizmodo’s words, “curtail competitors and tighten control on players of all sizes,” by creating a new version of the <a href="https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/SRD-OGL_V1.1.pdf">Open Game License</a> (OGL) and deauthorizing the original OGL 1.0a.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Open Game Licence is a public copyright license that was published by Wizards of the Coast in 2000. It opened up much of the game’s 3rd edition rules to third party use and guaranteed freedom for indie publishers and competitors. For over 20 years, thousands of creators have relied on the OGL to protect their livelihoods and creative freedom. The OGL is also thought to have greatly benefited WOTC: in 2014, the Academics Benoît Demil and Xavier Lecocq, in the economic journal <em>Revue d'économie industrielle</em>, determined that the OGL “was considered by WOTC's managers as a huge success due to the large movement of adoption it created among publishers.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With that context, it’s likely clear that WOTC’s attempt to change the contract was quite a big deal for the community, especially as <a href="http://ogl.battlezoo.com">full versions</a> of the new “OGL 1.1” found their way into the public eye. A look through the full OGL 1.1 document quickly reveals that, where the original OGL 1.0a was extremely broad and free of restriction, OGL 1.1 aimed to remove key freedoms and transfer power to WOTC. Under OGL 1.1, publishers would pay up to 25% in royalties to WOTC, waive their right to class action waivers and jury trial, and give WOTC ownership over all copyright, trademark, patent rights, and any rights not explicitly noted within the contract. OGL 1.1 also gave WOTC the ability to modify the terms of the contract at any time and, “for any reason whatsoever,” as well the freedom to use publishers' content, “for any purpose.” So under OGL 1.1, creators would essentially be giving WOTC full control over their content, in pretty much every way but name — and WOTC could change the terms of the agreement at any time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the wake of these leaks came a massive wave of outrage from thousands of creators and community members, culminating in many community members canceling their paid subscriptions to WOTC’s online resource, D&amp;D Beyond. While it's unclear just how many subscriptions WOTC lost in the early days of January, it was at least enough to warrant a public response from the company. On January 13th, the D&amp;D Beyond Team issued a statement titled, “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1423-an-update-on-the-open-game-license-ogl">An Update on the Open Game License (OGL)</a>.” This statement was notably not an apology, and more notably was quite clearly corporate drivel. The statement opens by claiming that the purpose of the OGL 1.1 was to “ prevent the use of D&amp;D content from being included in hateful and discriminatory products,” and prevent the use of “blockchain games, and NFT’s.” That’s all well and good, but the extremely restrictive and power hungry terms of OGL 1.1 make this seem like an excuse rather than a clarification. WOTC’s response continues, stating that the OGL 1.1 was “for the content creator, the homebrewer, the aspiring designer, our players, and the community—not major corporations to use for their own commercial and promotional purpose.” I think the irony inherent in this statement is clear?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After continued outrage from the community, this statement was followed by two more public messages from WOTC. They apologized to the community, and officially released an OGL 1.2 for public review by survey. The OGL 1.2 was slightly more tolerable: it contained no royalties, and restricted WOTC’s ability to modify the contract and use creators' content. However, it still required creators to agree to waive their right to file class action waivers and to a trial by jury. The numbers on the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1423-an-update-on-the-open-game-license-ogl">OGL 1.2 survey</a> demonstrated the TTRPG community’s feelings toward it: 88% of the more than 15,000 people who filled out the survey did not want to publish content under OGL 1.2, and 89% of them disliked the idea of WOTC changing the original OGL 1.0a at all. And, in a surprising turn, WOTC actually listened to the survey results. On January 27th, WOTC confirmed that they would leave the OGL 1.0a “in place, as is. Untouched.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>In Retrospect</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cool. That’s great. But to be clear, this is not something that Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro should be praised for — it is really not that hard to not attempt to monopolize a market and threaten the livelihoods of thousands of indie creators. Trust me. I do it every day! Ultimately the only thing WOTC did is solve a problem that they themselves created, and (allegedly) be sorry about it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;But wait. <em>Sorry</em>? No, I don’t think anyone at WOTC is sorry. WOTC is not a person, it’s a network of employees tied to executives tied to other corporations tied to a board of trustees. It's a system that lets people say, “I’m just doing my job,” a system that shifts blame into oblivion. Excuse me if I’m being overly cynical, but it seems to me that every move WOTC has made throughout this whole chain of events was made with the express goal of making the funny number go up – and nothing else. They stuck with the OGL 1.1 plan all the way up until it was clearly unprofitable, and now they’re pursuing some other angle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What that angle is, I don’t know. But this whole debacle should serve as a warning: the TTRPG community is not safe from corporate profiteering. Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro are not to be trusted. Continued reliance on an Open Game License owned by a predatory corporate power is simply untenable. This has happened before — it’s what led to the collapse of TSR (the original owners of D&amp;D), and to the failure of D&amp;D 4th edition. And, despite these repeated failures, there is no indication that something like this will not happen again. What the TTRPG community needs is a system agnostic open license that is not owned by a major company with stakes in the industry.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh wait, that's already soon to be a thing! Paizo, the producers of D&amp;D’s biggest competitor, Pathfinder, have, in response to the OGL controversy, begun the creation of the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si7v">Open RPG Creative License (ORC)</a>. This license will be outside of Paizos jurisdiction, and will specifically be irrevocable, unlike the OGL. I’m usually not one to trust or praise corporations, but the ORC license seems to be a mostly altruistic move from Paizo, and I hope that it represents a way forward for the TTRPG community. A way forward without the ever-looming shadow of WOTC &amp; Hasbro’s corporate greed.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(It also has a really cool name. Like ORC? What? Props to whoever thought of that.)</p>

<p>The first Senate Public of the semester began on Monday with surprisingly good attendance – likely due to the newly established Monday afternoon meeting time (which everyone rejoiced, of course).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the next commencement speaker, President Safi Zenger (‘24) reported that she and Vice President Sean Brown (‘24) had attended an earlier meeting where they worked on defining the qualities of a good speaker. “We’re going to lean towards choosing a speaker that is in the arts,” Zenger said, “someone who either was an art major while at Reed or in the arts now.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>President Zenger also reported that she finally received an email from the Academic Success Committee, though unfortunately cannot attend the meeting as she has a class at the same time. Senator Kiana Cunningham-Rodriguez (‘23) later chimed in to say she can go. With regards to other committees, Zenger has emailed and scheduled meetings with Academic Support, the Registrar’s Office, Dean of Students Tawana Parks, Vice President for Student Life Karnell McConnell-Black, Vice President and Dean for Institutional Diversity Phyllis Esposito, and Reed President Audrey Bilger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On his own committees, Brown reported that the first Finance Committee (FINCOM) meeting would take place on Tuesday. He also said that the Commencement meeting was a “slay meeting, very fun, really early.” For the Student Committee on Diversity (SCOD), he said they’re “still figuring it out” since there’s no out-of-Senate representation, and they’re determining how to get more representation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brown is still on the appeals board, mentioning that “people are saying treasurers should not be on appeals because they are not elected.” As the process continues, however, he added that “in the interim, I cannot escape. I cannot get out.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brown has set meetings with the Alumni, Accountability, and International Student Services (ISS) liaisons, and plans to reach out to Disability Accessibility Resources (DAR) soon. He, along with Senator Jefferson Ratliff (‘25), also met with Director for the Office of Student Engagement Janice Yang&nbsp; to get a student spaces tour. At the time of the Public, the Student Committee on Academic Planning (SCAP) was simultaneously meeting — Brown planned to update them afterwards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to Brown and Ratliff, Senator Luiz Felipe Horta (‘25) also has a separate meeting with Janice Yang on Friday to discuss the Student Union (SU). They have previously discussed different uses of the SU, especially with reference to safety concerns and the space “back there in the bong loft.” Senator Horta reported that he and Janice had also “talked a little about safety concerns in the SU.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senator Jefferson Ratliff, chair of the Appointments Committee, reported that applications for bike coop manager and wage review are up now. “Go and apply, both great positions, lots of fun!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ratliff, along with Student Body Head Treasurer Wani Pandey (‘23), reached out to the Computer Committee (CUS) to set up meetings to discuss working on wifi and printing. Senator Ratliff also mentioned that CUS is working to rename themselves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SHARE had their first meeting on Friday, working on their and Senate’s mutual goals. “We’re helping them review and work on potential legislation changes, and keeping communication open with them,” Ratliff said.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Student Body Vice Treasurer Nina Gopaldas (‘24) announced that she had “done the impossible,” — she scheduled her first Appeals training. On the Student Publications side, Gopaldas reported, “We reached out to the <em>Quest</em>. They’ve invited us to editing night.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On club budgets for this semester, Head Treasurer Wani Pandey said, “Check out SP info for the link to come at 7:00. Please have a budget in earlier than 5pm,” they continued,&nbsp; “just so we know who we’re expecting and have time to look over the budgets.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senator Meera Balan (‘26) announced that she has started working towards the promises in her campaign, addressing the lack of vegan and kosher options, and has scheduled a meeting with Bon Appétit to begin this process.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SHARE had their first meeting on Friday, working on their and Senate’s mutual goals. “We’re helping them review and work on potential legislation changes, and keeping communication open with them,” Senator Ratliff said. “They’d like us to help submit a piece of legislation that would add a clause to the AOD policy around giving any food or drink that contains any substance to someone without their consent.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In final news, Marketplace hours have changed, so that it now closes at 11:00 instead of midnight. On being asked about the change, Safi responded, “That’s crazy, it was an old senate project. An old president from my freshman year’s whole project was to get marketplace hours to 12 and now they’re at 11.” Senator Dukes plans to email Director of Dining Services Michael Bucuvalas about this issue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re on it,” announced Safi.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Theater fans rejoice! This semester at Reed there will be various productions to enjoy. First, Si Zheng Song’s puppet show <em>Antigona Furiosa</em> is currently being performed in Commons at 8:30pm on Friday, February 3rd and 6:30pm on Saturday, February 4th. Later in March, there will be two shows running back to back. Mark your calendars for Thursday, March 2nd through Saturday, March, 4th to attend Aaron Berlau and Anna Hendrickson’s <em>The Wild Boar of Chernobyl</em> and Will Stevens’ <em>Blue Heart: A Frankenstein Story</em>. Finally, faculty member Barbie Wu and her associate director Jody Read will be leading <em>The Last Croissant</em> and will be performing from April 20th through the 22nd. Student tickets are only $3 for both thesis and faculty productions, so be sure to attend if possible and support our theater majors!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Si Zheng Song’s thesis project <em>Antigona Furiosa</em> retells Sophocles' <em>Antigone</em> with puppetry and is accompanied by live music. Through a frame narrative, audiences watch Antigone telling her story in an 80s Argentinian cafe. “I hope people will see the play and recognize Antigone from around us. She is a reminder of everyone who talks back to power and fights against something larger in life,” writes Song in an email interview. “By commemorating and bringing these efforts to center stage, we can perhaps direct our attention to celebrating the efforts made, moving past anguish and frustration, and how supporting each other throughout this process builds community, so that as a whole, we can imagine and bring about a world that's less hostile for more people.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The puppets are so cool!!!” Song adds. She extended gratitude to the show artists, her director Luz, the Bon Appetit staff, and the theater department. “[Bon Appetite was] very friendly to us and expressed great support, and we in turn are very glad to bring art and music into their space. It feels good to know that the community welcomes art and is very generous to us,” Song writes. “I'm grateful for the Theatre Department for being patient, supportive, and accommodating throughout this unconventional project, and for being excited about this project.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I am very moved by their dedication and sustained engagement throughout the process. And a huge thank you to Luz, who helped me direct this play and who brought a very unique humanness to the project — I really appreciate their efforts and insights! It was a joy to be in the rehearsal room with this group of people, and I hope we deliver that joy to you, the audience.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As director Aaron Berlau describes, <em>The Wild Boar of Chernobyl</em><em> </em>is a horror show set in a post-nuclear apocalyptic world. With the human population living underground, a preacher and his family challenge the assumption that the Earth’s surface is uninhabitable and claim that the radiation will in fact save humans. The show continues to follow the consequences of this and the subsequent “crazy” that comes out of this, as Berlau describes. “My designers have already like done a great job of creating images and ideas of what they want to do so throughout the next few weeks, it's just all going to come to fruition and actually happen and that's what I'm really excited for: just seeing the show, piece by piece, come together.”</p>

<p>“My whole thesis is about horror theater,” Berlau explains. “I'm trying to create a definition of what it looks like on the stage, how it reads on the text, and create a case for its validity because I feel like horror as a genre so often devalued and looked down upon as a lesser in academic circles.” They add that “this show is especially fascinating the way it discusses religion and science and how that affects the health and safety of a community.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hendrickson’s thesis concerns immersive theater: “my role for the show has been to design an immersive set which places the audience inside the world of The Wild Boar of Chernobyl,” they wrote in an email interview, “the script itself is quite horrifying—it’s a very creepy and gory show, and combining it with immersive theatre, which places audiences inside the action of the show, makes it all the more haunting.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think horror has one of the best, most direct ways to approach social commentary and critique,” Berlau continues. “The horror genre is able to explore a lot of important world events, very contemporarily, in a way that other genres don't have the ability to explore as in depth. As far as horror theater goes, the element of theater is really important because being in the same room as some of these acts that are happening, like having people witness these moments of gore and violence on stage or limbs coming out of other places just really heightens the effects of the play in a way that horror movies can't do as well.” <em>The Wild Boar of Chernobyl</em><em> </em>will be performed in the theater annex, across the street from 28 West, during the first week of March.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through studying different adaptations of Marry Shelley’s original <em>Frankenstein</em>, director Will Stevens of <em>Blue Heart</em> explains how “when you're telling a Frankenstein story, the least important thing you have to worry about is what actually happens in the book.” Rather, adaptations explore core themes and relevant fears of the society that produced it from industrialization to atomic bombs. Stevens stitched together two plays by Caryl Churchill and created another <em>Frankenstein</em> story to join the legacy. Their story follows a Frankenstein character exiled from home and confronts themes of parenting and generational trauma. Stevens elaborates, “When you spend a lot of time in not necessarily abusive but unhealthy environments and relationships, and then you get out of those environments and relationships, it's extraordinarily difficult to deprogram all that stuff that you've inadvertently learned about relationships, environments, in the way that the world is and the way that your life is and the way that you see yourself.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It's also literally about a creature who is raised in a lab environment and is exiled from that lab,” adds Stevens. “[The creature] has to figure out how to live their life and figure out how to make connections and understand other people and to have been looking at the world as if it is a lab experiment so far.” During the show, this creature convinces older women that he is their son, and tension boils later in the plot during a dinner party between the protagonist, his girlfriend, and an older couple. “It sort of almost comes to a head,” describes Stevens. “You're praying for anything to break because the father thinks that the creature is a co-worker of the mother. He doesn't know that she's secretly his son, even though he's not and so there's this network of lies that's going on and different people know or believe different things. And if just one person just said anything different, this whole house of cards essentially topples and someone breaks this cycle of deception.” Go out and see <em>Blue Heart</em><em> </em>during the first week of March!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reed’s mainstage production <em>The Last Croissant</em> — a clown tragedy — is directed by professor Barbie Wu and assisted by junior theater major Jody Read, helping them prepare for bigger ventures senior year. The show explores gender roles, relationships, and expectations within those relationships. Set in a campsite, the show follows a few pairs of people trying to negotiate what they mean to each other. By finding the “extraordinary in the mundane,” both Wu and Read hope audiences will see the beauty in the strangeness of the show and the absurdity of existence in this more light-hearted play. “I really wanted to focus on a play that brings joy to students,” says Wu. “Hopefully they agree, too.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I'm excited to explore the weirdness that's coming out of [theater],” says Read. “I think the weirdness of theater is one of my favorite aspects of it.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wu goes on to explain, “I feel like every successful dramatic writing has a tipping point in shows where these people are facing some sort of tipping point in their lives and there is going to be a chemical reaction where they're no longer the same afterward. I'm hoping that there will also be a chemical reaction in the room and maybe a part of them are altered.”</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Derek Applewhite's lab seeks to understand the regulation of the cytoskeleton. Just as we have bones and muscles that give our bodies shape and allow us to move, cells have analogous structures known as the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton is critical to the shape change or morphogenesis cells undergo during development, immune functions, the path finding that developing neurons undergo when establishing connections, and in cases where the cytoskeletal machinery works aberrantly, metastasis during tumorigenesis.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Optical measurements of materials in condensed matter is a growing field. In particular, pump-probe measurements enable researchers to probe the dynamics of excitations in many materials. Many such research directions require a magneto-optic cryostat to reach low temperature and high magnetic field. Traditional cryostats use liquid helium, which is costly and inconvenient. Closed-cycle cryocoolers eliminate the need for liquid helium, but introduce vibrations, so care must be taken to reduce vibrations. The development of a low-vibration, cryocooled magneto-optic cryostat (&lt;1.7 K and 7 tesla) will be presented. Measurements of the dynamics of spin-polarized excitons in InSe, measured in the cryostat, will also be shown.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bringing Down Cancer’s Most Evasive Target (5:30 p.m. @ Vollum lecture Hall)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shokat is a chemist who researches pharmaceutical treatments against some of the most common drivers of human cancers. He is best known for targeting a mutation that drives more than 1 in 10 lung cancers, which opened up a new arena of cancer treatment discovery. The target, K-Ras, is the most common driver of cancer and was considered “undruggable” by most cancer researchers after 40 years of failed attempts to block its function. Shokat’s discovery of a K-Ras blocker broke through this decades-old barrier and threw open the doors to a new class of cancer treatments.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Grounds Crew, also known as the Canyon Crew, have partnered with Teamsters Local 305, a Portland Labor Union, to form Reed's first Grounds Union. The vote was counted on January 26th. Four members of the crew of five voted to unionize. The fifth member was hired only recently, and so was ineligible to vote, rendering the decision unanimous. Union members sat down with the<em> </em><em>Quest</em> to discuss their reasons for unionization.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Grounds Union laid out their grievances in three main categories: compensation, security, and recognition. Wages, they say, are not competitive, and are significantly below nearby institutions for the same positions. The Crew hopes to use their union to negotiate better pay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Grounds Union is also worried about job security. They feel threatened by the college, and fear they will be replaced by contractors. Members reported multiple occasions where they felt that their superiors were actively considering hiring contractors to do the work that the Union felt was supposed to be their responsibility. The Union got few and vague answers when they questioned these actions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Union also feels that they get little recognition for the work that they do. The path for promotion is clouded with hand-waving and lip service, and many of the crew feel that promotion is all but a lost cause for them. They have been told repeatedly that their highly relevant education is of no importance to the jobs they do, and they do not even know what their job description is supposed to be. It took two members years to get a copy of anything that resembled a job description, but they were quickly told that the descriptions in question were outdated and invalid. The Union feels that they execute a diversity of tasks in their positions that are highly relevant to their respective educations, and are consistently given arbitrary reasons why they do not deserve to hold specialist roles rather than general technicians. Tasks that the Crew take pride in such as supervising student workers or designing and implementing canyon restoration are downplayed or outright ignored by the Crew's supervisors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Members of the Union discussed how they felt major differences between their lived experience in their jobs and what they have heard from their supervisors. The Union expressed frustration that job skill seemed to be independent of the potential for moving up, achieving better pay and more job security, and being recognized for the creativity they bring to their workplaces. The discussion dwelled on the arbitrary hierarchy they see above them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One Union member pointed out the disconnect between the creative responsibility they felt they were hired to do and the order-following grunt work that they find themselves being pushed into. The member called this disconnect “gaslighting,” and explained how unionization seemed the only way to ensure that the Crew would be guaranteed to be heard by those above them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We are doing this because we love Reed," one union member said, urging the student body to take a look at their beautiful surroundings. Reed's landscape is a work of love born from the labor of a handful of dedicated people who have devoted their lives to the science and art of caring for and curating community ecology. The Grounds Crew, as well as much of the student body, faculty, staff, local community members, and local flora and fauna, are intimately connected to the Reed Canyon, regarding it not as something consumable but as a living, changing, breathing environment. Tired with the production-oriented rhetoric of some administration, one Union member said simply, "The Canyon is a process, not a product."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“We are doing this because we love Reed.”</p><cite><em>Grounds Union Member</em></cite></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Grounds Crew see unionization as an opportunity to solidify their job descriptions and be recognized for all the work that they do. One member of the Union described his position fondly, explaining how he feels like a steward of the land and local ecology. His work centers around canyon restoration, but feels as if his supervisors dismiss the core of his work, as some refuse to admit that the canyon needs any more restoration. Despite being hired with a relevant degree in forestry management, he has been told that he does not actually use his education to do his job.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Reasonable demands from reasonable people," said one Union member. The Grounds crew repeatedly brought up Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion as part of their grievances with the college. They feel that Reed is hypocritical on all three points when it comes to class. They curate Reed's landscape with the intention to reflect these principles, working with the ecological processes of the land to promote species diversity and craft equitable and inclusive paths around campus. But they feel the weight of Reed's hierarchies, and are forced to ask: when will the college honor its own mission statement?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <em>Quest</em> reached out to Zackariah Perry and Steve Yeadon, who supervise the Grounds Crew. Both declined to comment, and instead the College issued a statement through the Executive Director of Public Affairs and Communications Sheena McFarland:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Reed has a record of working successfully with unions; our custodians chose to unionize many years ago. The Grounds Technicians are a valued and important part of the Reed community. The college respects the right of the Grounds Technicians to organize and respects the union-organizing process. The college is following all guidance from the National Labor Relations Board.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Grounds Union asks the student body and alumni community to show solidarity with their efforts to achieve fair wages, job security, and recognition for their work outside of lip service. To the administration, they ask for democracy in the workplace: "Where is the equity?"</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hello fellow Quest enthusiasts!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We hope everyone had a very well-rested break. As you begin a new sleep-deprived semester, we as well reignite our Wednesday night to Thursday morning all-nighters, many smoke breaks, and caffeine-powered pursuit of the new and noteworthy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What’s new this semester?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have a third semester return from Anie “CoffeeXredbull” Kotha as well as second semester returns from Cass “weed makes me focus more” Biles and Madeleine “smoke break?” Voth. Meanwhile, we also have two new editors: Declan “yes but do dogs have knees?” Bradley and Chloe “my plants are close to mutiny” Hsy!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On top of this, we have a couple of other changes. Contributor meetings have been moved to 6 pm on Tuesday nights. And, hopefully, in a continuation from last semester, we will be getting a new title from our friends at the calligraphy club.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Now a little bit about your editors for the spring semester.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite being both sleep deprived and overworked, Anie continues to start her days with coffee and red bull. But, not thanks to a new edition to the marketplace, she has now replaced her coffee with straight espresso. While she continues to work for the Quest she hopes to bring new writers to bring different perspectives on a variety of topics. While she hopes she gets rest this semester for 9 AMs on Thursdays, she wouldn’t be terribly upset if she would need to stay up for a hard hitting story.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New editor Declan is already at work on a new version of the Quest site and, when not in class or reading a book somewhere in the canyon, is likely to be found holed up in the SPO listening to music and muttering something incoherent about semicolons and divs. Like Anie, Declan looks forward to working with both new and returning Quest writers this semester, and plans to spend more than a few late nights in the Quest office (before staggering into his 9 AM history class on Thursday morning).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Continuing (barely) editor Cass Biles is starting her 2nd semester on Quest ready and rolling!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cass is excited this spring-time to publish exciting new stories, from Renn Fayre Popes, to the gym’s reconstruction, to the relentless hope that we will one day profile Luis Giraldo. Through the trudges of organic chemistry, over the hills of reading Hobbes, and finally skiing the mountains of 5am editors nights, Cass is tumbling along and ready to bring you new content!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second semester editor Madeleine is feeling good about this semester, mainly because she no longer has a 9am on Thursday mornings, and instead will be able to make it to class (hopefully) a little bit less sleep deprived. She is looking forward to another semester of singing along to Mamma Mia in the Quest room and taking copious amounts of smoke breaks, and is hoping for little to no scandals this semester (fingers crossed!)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chloe has started the semester with an impulsive dye job and by catching (what feels like) the plague. One week in, and she’s spent five hours in the ER only to learn that she is *shrugs* probably fine. She’s super excited to start work with the Quest, to have a productive excuse for her too common all-nighters, and for a semester that is <em>hopefully</em> up from here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Come visit us during our sleep-deprived editing nights or contributors meetings, and we wish you the best of luck during this new semester!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph {"dropCap":true} -->
<p class="has-drop-cap">To be clear, Netflix original <em>The Old Guard</em> is a ridiculous movie that has no reason to exist, but I love it anyway. Charlize Theron plays Andromache of Scythia, leader of a small band of immortal warriors with the ability to heal from any injury, no matter how fatal. Theron, admirably stubborn in her refusal to admit that she might be too good for this movie, brings what I can only describe as depressed-Jason-Bourne energy to the role, alternately chugging vodka, kicking ass, and staring off into the distance while delivering epic monologues about the crushing weight of her 5000 years of life.</p>

<p>Joining her are Booker, an ex-Napoleonic soldier whose only character trait seems to be a love of old books, and Joe and Nickie – star-crossed lovers who ran away together during the Crusades. The motley crew, we’re told, were brought together by a series of prophetic dreams that came upon them whenever a new immortal was born. Together, their army of four have spent millennia "fighting in the shadows" to make a better world for humanity, all while trying desperately to avoid discovery by human governments. Unfortunately for the world, Andromache is losing hope that their efforts have done any good, and is on the edge of giving up the fight in favor of an eternal retirement.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Enter Nile Freeman: a young American marine in Afghanistan, and brand new immortal, who counters Andy's world-weary cynicism and unstoppable martial arts skills with youthful passion and naive inexperience. (Almost like she's a purpose-written foil designed to remind her new mentor why they fight before taking up the torch, which wouldn't be at all like every other action movie ever made, no...)</p>

<p>Once our heroes are established and they all duel each other for a bit to establish who the pack alpha is (Theron, obviously), the team head to London to do battle with Steven Merrick — a tech-bro supervillain with a strong Mark Zuckerberg resemblance who wants … uh … money, I guess?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They'll also be fighting the CIA for some reason, but by this point in the movie I've stopped trying to understand the plot in favor of sitting back to enjoy the choreography of the action sequences.</p>

<!-- /wp:image --></div>
<!-- /wp:column --></div>
<!-- /wp:columns -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And oh what action sequences they are. Remember, dear reader, that most action movies aren't quite so willing to break the fourth wall as this gem of the genre. We, the audience, may know that the main character of an action flick can never die, but <em>they</em> don't know that. As a result, our beloved heroes waste valuable screen time on silly things like ducking and the human fear of death. Not so with <em>The Old Guard</em>. Andy and her team have transcended so far beyond the normal rules of engagement that we need not fear for their safety, or the safety of pretty much any named character in this movie, because they're all literally immortal.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thus, we are free to sit back, relax, and enjoy the increasingly unlikely acrobatics demonstrated by Theron and her apprentice as they slay their way through hordes of CIA operatives and soulless corporate minutemen. (Which, let's be honest, is all I really want from my action movies anyway, so it works surprisingly well.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet that's not even the best thing about this movie. The sound track? Impeccable. Andy's weirdly intense relationship with that medieval axe she carries around in a violin case? 10/10. Our heroes' bizarre choice to spend most of the film wearing white t-shirts despite the fact that they keep getting shot in the chest on a daily basis? I am in awe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div>
<!-- /wp:column --></div>
<!-- /wp:columns -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All joking aside, I actually kind of love this movie. Sure, it's absolutely absurd, but it goes over the top on all the right notes. It has the entertainment value of a classic superhero flick coupled with spot-on casting, especially in the case of Theron as Andy and KiKi Layne as Nile. While their teammates are jostled out of the limelight a bit by Theron's star power, Joe and Nickie still find time for some sweet on-screen moments, and the second half of the film packs some legitimate twists that put rival action franchises to shame. So as ridiculous as <em>The Old Guard</em> may be, I have a soft spot for its lovable team of undying oddballs, and I highly recommend that anyone who hasn't yet had the privilege of seeing it, and its upcoming sequel, find time on a Friday night to sit down, open a laptop, and prepare to be amazed.</p>

<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> has some big shoes to fill. The previous game in the series, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, was practically guaranteed a sequel from the moment of its release in 2017, especially after it was voted the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-100-video-games-of-all-time">Best Video Game of All Time by IGN</a>. </p>

<!-- wp:column -->
<div class="wp-block-column"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet, for years, there was no news. Breath of the Wild was a breathtakingly ambitious project — complete with a full open world system that pushed the boundaries of what was considered possible at the time — and any sequel would have to be even more so. Brief teasers would be unveiled here and there, but the development team was largely cagey about what, exactly, they were building, and when it would be done. We knew we were waiting for something stunning, but not for how long.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, we know. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div>
<!-- /wp:column --></div>
<!-- /wp:columns -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At Nintendo Direct on Wednesday, the company unveiled an official gameplay trailer for the sequel, complete with details that will leave fans excited. We see Link diving through the skies (sign me up), charging into combat against ancient machinery (oh no!), and even seemingly crafting ancient devices of his own, including a makeshift car and quadrotor (shut up and take my money). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But none of that compares to the most exciting part of the reveal, a date: 5.12.2023. The long awaited release date, it seems, is only a few months away. Guess I'll be buying a Nintendo Switch this summer...</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Friday, February 10th</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Student Mixer with Kevan M. Shokat ‘86 (1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. @ Eliot Hall 103)</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Looking to learn more about research, advancements in pharmaceutical treatments against cancer, and networking with distinguished Reed alumni? Join Kevan M. Shokat ‘86, the 2022 Howard Vollum Award for Distinguished Accomplishment in Science and Technology recipient, at this student mixer to learn more about his research and connect. Light snacks and desserts will be provided!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shokat is a chemist who researches pharmaceutical treatments against some of the most common drivers of human cancers. He is best known for targeting a mutation that drives more than 1 in 10 lung cancers, which opened up a new arena of cancer treatment discovery. The target, K-Ras, is the most common driver of cancer and was considered “undruggable” by most cancer researchers after 40 years of failed attempts to block its function. Shokat’s discovery of a K-Ras blocker broke through this decades-old barrier and threw open the doors to a new class of cancer treatments.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What it means to be black (1:00 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. @ Eliot Hall 419)</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What it means to be black is back and a little different. In this workshop series, we will delve into the psychological impacts of racism and racial oppression on the African diaspora, and learn techniques for healing and coping with these traumas. By examining the legacy of systemic racism and its ongoing effects on our present, we hope to facilitate a process of personal and collective healing from the inside out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Biology Seminar: Dr. Greta Binford (4:10 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. @ Psychology 105)</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://college.lclark.edu/live/profiles/22-greta-binford">Dr. Binford's</a> research program uses integrative, evolutionary approaches to better understand patterns of diversity in spider venoms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brown recluses and their relatives (genus Loxosceles) are famous for venoms that can cause nasty lesions when they bite people. The toxins that cause these lesions, called phospholipase Ds, are unique to the Sicariidae spider family that includes Loxosceles and their near relatives – the super cool six-eyed sand spiders. Dr. Binford will describe her work uncovering the biogeographic history of sicariidae, and share what’s been learned about the evolutionary origin and diversification of these PLD toxins. The story includes evidence of lateral gene transfer, functional diversification of a poorly understood gene family, and expansion of the complexity of the venom proteome. The result is venoms that are dominated by potent insecticidal PLD neurotoxins.</p>

If we decide to engage in a walking experience on the Reed campus, the pace will be slow and the focus will be on engaging your senses. The paths may be uneven/muddy. The focus of these practices will be to strengthen your relationship with the land and nature and to transition from “thinking” to “sensing” and from “doing” to “being” which will help facilitate nonjudgmental present-moment focus, connection, self-reflection, and centering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exhibition: Dark Moves (12:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. @ Cooley Art Gallery)</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Menchelli and Watkins employ color, line, and saturation—dematerializing modernist geometries, and transforming planarity into ascending angles and curves. Their experiments produce enigmatic effects and lacunae—voids and folds that touch and trace one another. In Dark Moves, Menchelli brings new dimensionality to her translucent color photograms, made entirely in the dark—folding and manipulating the photosensitive paper. These alchemical agents become embodied sculptures mounted on a stainless steel substructure that thrust their geometric volumes, casting shadows on the wall. In the darkened surroundings of the space, Watkins transforms the dynamic linearity of her ink-based drawings into rising, swooping organic forms that radiate wild shadows. These sculptural forms accompany numinous gold reliefs created by imperceptible forces, and small works on paper that oscillate between a fluid lyricism and darker visions of interior compression.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Chemistry Seminar: Isabelle Baconguis, Ph.D. "Insights into the function of trimeric Na+-selective ion channels" (4:15 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. @ Biology, 19)</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Isabelle Baconguis graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a B.A. in Biochemistry.&nbsp; She remained at PENN for two years studying glutamate receptors. Interested in ion channel physiology, she joined the Neuroscience Graduate Program at OHSU and joined Dr. Eric Gouaux’s lab in the Vollum Institute. During her doctoral research at the Vollum Institute, she studied acid sensing ion channels (ASICs), members of the superfamily of amiloride-sensitive and Na<sup>+</sup>-selective trimeric ion channels. Using a combination of x-ray crystallography and electrophysiology, she exploited toxin-dependent modulation of ASIC function to elaborate molecular mechanisms of gating, selectivity and ion channel block. As a recipient of the NIH Director’s Early Independence Award, part of High-Risk High-Reward Program, Isabelle skipped postdoctoral training to immediately pursue her research program of understanding water and salt balance using structural techniques initially focusing on the epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). She joined the Vollum Institute as the inaugural Vollum fellow in 2013 and was promoted to assistant scientist in 2016.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Kū Kiaʻi Aloha: Decolonial Intimacies and Governance Beyond the "Nation Straight” (5:00 p.m. @ Vollum Lounge)</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 2022-23 Vine Deloria Lecture and Sex, Gender, and Sexuality Symposium will feature <a href="https://jamaicaosorio.wordpress.com/">Dr. Jamaica Heolimeleikalani Osorio</a>. Dr. Osorio is Assistant Professor of Indigenous and Native Hawaiian Politics at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our story begins at the base of a sacred mountain, Mauna a Wākea. She is a beacon for navigators, dreamers, and philosophers. She is a gathering place for visionaries in the realm of the gods. She is the piko (summit and convergence) of our ea (sovereignty and liberation). And she is under constant threat of desecration by the State of Hawaiʻi. But this is not simply a story detailing the violences of the state, racial capitalism, and the ongoing removal of Indigenous peoples from our lands. This is an ʻŌiwi moʻolelo that honors the stories and teachings of our ancestors and the relational systems they developed to teach us to live in balance and justice with our people and environments. This is a Hawaiian moʻolelo that takes seriously the counter hegemonic and counter heteropatriarchal practices of aloha ʻāina that root us in the land and create abundance for generations to come. This is an abolitionist moʻolelo that centers genuine security and celebrates what we continue to build in the face and aftermath of all the colonial violences that have come for our lands, our bodies, and our dreams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://jamaicaosorio.wordpress.com/">Dr. Jamaica Heolimeleikalani Osorio</a> is a Kanaka Maoli wahine artist, activist, and scholar. She earned her Ph.D. in English (Hawaiian literature) in 2018 from the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. Dr. Osorio is a three-time national poetry champion, poetry mentor and a published author. In 2020 her poetry and activism were the subject of an award-winning film, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DziSF--bow"><em>This is the Way We Rise</em></a> which premiered at Sundance Film Festival in 2021. In 2022 she was a lead artist and co-writer of the revolutionary VR documentary, <a href="https://www.onthemorningyouwake.com/"><em>On the Morning You Wake (To the end of the world)</em></a><em>, </em>that premiered at Sundance Film Festival 2022 and won the XR experience Jury award at SXSW 2022. She is a proud past Kaiāpuni student, Ford Dissertation (2017) and Post Doctoral (2022) Fellow, and a graduate of Kamehameha, Stanford University (BA) and New York University (MA). She is the author of the award winning book <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/remembering-our-intimacies"><em>Remembering our Intimacies: Moʻolelo, Aloha ʻĀina, and Ea</em></a> which was published in 2021 by The University of Minnesota Press.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Darling Reader,&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since leaving home for Reed, I’ve learned a <em>vital</em> lesson:&nbsp; I love to flirt. Whether or not I’m good at wooing people is not relevant to this article, lest my skills are denied by the boys I’ve approached in the Pool Hall. (I’ve charmed y’all off your feet, right?) And, with Valentine’s Day fast approaching, I’m about to have an absolute ball. With Love Ball so near, now is the peak time to start practicing how you’re going to rizz that pretty someone you’re dying to confess your feelings to (or whose pants you want to get into).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, Amanda, you protest, I have no idea what I’m doing! Fortunately for you, my sweet summer child, I’ve spent this last week asking Reedies their go-to flirting tactics:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“<em>Because men are so deprived of attention, all you have to do is ask about their interests, compliment them, and notice the little things. Oh, and make eye contact. And when you make eye contact with them in a big group, smile at them a little before looking away</em>.” -Nana ‘26</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“<em>I’d say compliment them on something [like what they’re wearing] and then take the convo from there</em>” -Prasiddhi ‘25</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“<em>People love to hear about themselves. So make them talk about themselves.</em>” Omar ‘25</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“<em>I like to make little drawings and little notes and little gestures. I get my partner flowers a lot. Drawings and stuff</em>.” -Galen ‘25</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“<em>Looking. And then not making any eye contact when they notice. Then never speaking to them again. It works pretty well.</em>” -Anonymous ‘25&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“<em>I approach. I’m pretty loud and extroverted, which I use to my advantage. And I make the guy think he’s </em>so<em> interesting.</em>” -Hannah ‘25</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“<em>One of the underrated ways is breaking into the rhododendron garden with them at night. Just climbing over the fence with them. It’s very romantic and pleasant. Highly recommend it</em>.” -Declan ‘23</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(You can get in during the day with your Reed ID for free if “crime” is not your method. Or if you’re someone who cannot scale a fence. )&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“<em>Sharing music. It’s also something I do with my friends. But, that way, I can have them follow up and be like, ‘yeah, what’d you think?</em>’” -Anonymous ‘26</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“<em>Blow cigarette smoke into someone else’s mouth</em>” -Zoe ‘26&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(Please make sure you know this person will be comfortable with this before you do so.)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“<em>Invite them to your KRRC session! Plus, you don’t </em>have <em>to talk if you’re nervous. And, if you do, you need to be close to hear each other. Get some good whispering-in-their-ear action, y’know?”</em><em> </em>- Anonymous ‘24</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“You need to compliment someone on who they are and what they like. Not because you want something but because you find them genuinely interesting”</em><em> </em>-Anonymous ‘24</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“<em>You can’t plan out flirting. It’s gotta be spontaneous. You gotta be genuinely into that person to get somewhere.”</em><em> -</em>Anonymous ‘24</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, before you run off with all these ideas, you can’t start practicing rizzing your intended person without my handy-dandy <em>Rizzelations</em><em>.</em> I believe any chances are moot without them. Because, with these under your belt, your flirting will do what it’s <em>really</em> meant to do–let you have fun.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AMANDA’S RIZZELATIONS:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Thou must acknowledge that rejection is not something to be feared. All pain is temporary.&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Thou must lead with a non-attached mindset. Hope for a yes, but don’t expect one! (Expecting a “yes” might risk making you look creepy!)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Thou must know thou art a baddie–through and through. People can sense self-consciousness, even when it’s subtle, and that’s something we feel intuitively about others.&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Thou shall acknowledge that just because thou asked someone out–no matter the answer–thou slayeth pussy-queen-“girl”-boss.&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Thou will come to know that a date is a way to see if <em>thou</em> art romantically interested in someone, not the other way around. Be nervous about whether <em>you’ll</em> like <em>them</em>.&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>A no is a no. Thou won’t negotiate, bargain, or clarify. (They think going out on a date means you’re looking for a relationship, but you just want something casual? No need to specify.) They'll come to you if they change their mind or are curious about what you mean.&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Thou has the right to change your mind. Just as they’re allowed to reject you, you have the right to stop things. Your comfort matters more than how you’re perceived.&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Thou will <em>never</em> chase once rejected, nor wait for them to change their mind. <em>Don’t ask someone out again after they’ve said no</em>. Thou hath put thyself on their radar. That’s all that matters. (Pushing will make them uncomfortable and discourage them from wanting to spend any time with you. Disrespecting this rule will absolutely make you come off as a creep.)&nbsp;</li>

<p><em>No ball, just throw</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Name: Ginger</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Breed: ½ Irish Setter, ½ Golden Retriever</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Age: 4 ½ years</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rating: 14/10</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’ve ever been to the Sports Center, maybe you’ve seen this golden angel in the backpack co-op/Climbing wall room! Ginger, also known as Ginny, is an absolute sweetheart of a pup. She loves to be pet by everyone, and if you pass by, she will watch you in the hope of attracting attention. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ginny also loves playing with her ball, although it can be hard on the hardwood floors of the co-op. She slips and slides but she just loves playing catch too much! If you have the ball and she wants it, she might let out a little “woof” at you, just to remind you that it’s time for throwing. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When she’s not in the Sports Center, Ginny also loves to go hiking, skiing and canoeing. Canoeing is her favorite, she loves to wade in the water for hours! That probably has something to do with both of her breeds being duck hunting dogs. If you do go and visit Ginny, she will probably try to lick you. And if you let her, she won’t stop until you stop her (or until she gets distracted by her ball)! Don’t worry though, she’s not trying to get to your bones, she’s just trying to pet you back! Honestly 14/10, would throw the ball for her for as long as she wanted.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the 16<sup>th</sup> of December, 2022, my friends and I were planning on going to see the Portland Trail Blazers play the Denver Nuggets. It was setting up to be a very exciting game; Blazer’s legend Damian Lillard was finally back from injury and with the tickets being dirt cheap, I managed to convince a decent amount of friends to go with me. While waiting in the common room of my dorm building for the final friend to show up, a genius idea popped into my head; <em>what if I took a decent amount of edibles and watched the game high out of my mind?</em><em> </em>&nbsp;And with the plan of taking a 50-minute bus ride to get to the Moda Center comfortably early, I decided there was no time like the present for such an experience.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After heading back from taking the edibles in my room, I learned that my friend was going to be late, late enough for us to miss the last possible bus to get there in time. Thankfully, my friends had already accounted for that by ordering an Uber, the only problem being that we would get there just before the start of the game. Which means I would have to deal with getting all of my friends into the arena—as I was the sole owner of all of their tickets—high off my ass. By the time the Uber arrived, I was already feeling the effects. Crammed into the backseat of an UberXL, my sense of forbidding started to grow as the scenery outside my window turned from quiet suburb to the heart of Portland. To my drug-addled brain, it felt like a series of challenges were being imposed upon me, the reward being to sit and watch the game with my friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first hurdle I needed to overcome was to find my fifth and final friend, Drew. He had managed to find his own mode of transportation and had been loitering around Moda for the better part of an hour. With my phone being the only way to access the tickets, he had no way to get into the building, and since it was a cold December evening, he needed to find some avenue of keeping warm. The text, “I’m by the large fire” was the only ominous hint he had given me about his whereabouts. After walking halfway around the venue, we eventually found him in front of what I can only describe as an Olympics style torch, staring wistfully into the flames. I grabbed him and we slipped into the sea of people, following the tide into the bottleneck of the front entrance. At this point, the drugs truly started to take hold, and all I could do was try to stay calm and find where my tickets were located on my phone. I had probably rehearsed the interaction with the ticket taker at least 20 times in that line and by the time I got up to the machine, it felt like I was reading off a script. I still managed to fuck it up. I couldn’t for the life of me figure out where to put my phone on the reader, the person operating the machine eventually took pity and guided my phone to the correct location. Following that embarrassing interaction and an intense but unnoteworthy trip through security, we were in.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The venue itself was insane. The thousands of people milling around created a wall of noise that I so easily got lost in. I swear to god, I saw Kevin Durant walk past me, but I realize now that that 5’ 7’ person wearing Adidas track pants was not KD. That was also about the time the munchies were hitting hard. Drew, in an attempt to not pay for his ticket, insisted on buying me a meal, so we spent the next 20 minutes walking around the entire venue three times before finally settling on a pretzel stand. He then proceeded to buy me the cheapest thing on the menu, calling his debts absolved. When we finally got to our seats, everything hit me like a truck. All the sights and sounds I associated with watching basketball on TV were here right in front of me. The court seemed infinitely far away, but at the same time close enough to touch. Watching the game was blowing my mind, these people were (and I cannot stress this enough) just playing basketball. That thought was fucking me up. It’s not like I was expecting more, but it just struck my intoxicated brain as crazy that 18,000 people took the time out of their day to go to this game. That’s not even mentioning the millions of people watching from their homes. Sports are weird. I don’t have much to say about the game in specific that wouldn’t bore the shit out of any non-sports fan, so for the sake of space, I’ll skip most of the events of the game. I will say, though, that watching 10 giants running around trying to put a ball into a hole was objectively funny and quite interesting from a sociological perspective.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Preceding the game, the trip back to campus came to be an adventure in itself. Transferring from trains to buses at night in the middle of downtown Portland as a paranoid high person was stressful, but also had it’s comedic moments. On the final bus ride of our journey, the person I was sitting next to was on a voice call with their friends and kept using the word “Smort.” At first they used it sparingly, but as the conversation went on he started just repeating different iteration of the word. An average sentence would sound like “Smort smort smorts, smorting smorted smort!” They also claimed to be the smort king. It’s also worth noting their friends were named Broccoli and Savage. It felt like I was hallucinating that whole interaction, but all my sober friends corroborated the story so I guess it was real.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We eventually made it back to campus safe and sound, and I went directly to bed.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At Senate public on Tuesday, senators officially confirmed that the Restorative Justice board will not receive student body funds this semester. “We would like to reaffirm that RJ is not getting funding this semester,” Vice President Sean Brown said, “We talked about it before, but this is now confirmed.” Brown further stated that, “We discussed [this] at exec last time, but we had a whole bunch of other things going on, so we kind of forgot about that.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, Appointments Committee Chair Jefferson Ratliff announced that applications for Wage Review, Bike Co-op Manager, and J-Board secretary are now live on Handshake, and encouraged all to apply. Ratliff also shared that they have a meeting scheduled for February 21st with the Sustainability Committee to discuss a working definition of sustainability, which is “where we left off last semester.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ratliff is also staying in “active communication” with SHARE about the legislation proposals discussed in last week’s Senate Beat, and attended the first meeting of SCAP (Student Committee on Academic Planning), at which they discussed the notes from the first meeting of CAPP (Committee on Academic Policy Planning) and were introduced to the new hires for this semester. Ratliff reported that they had raised the issue of better informing the student body about SCAP activities, and proposed a possible return of SCAP Beat, a column which used to be printed in the Quest. Finally, Ratliff and other senators were given a tour of student spaces by Janice Yang, Director for the Office of Student Engagement, and discussed how to better manage space and allocate items to clubs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Res Life news, senator Astrid Liu met with Residence Life Assistant Director Jen Hickman to discuss policy changes to Reed’s on-call system. Previously, only Area Coordinators were expected to be on call, but individual HAs may soon be expected to be on call for 24 hours a day as well. Hickman reportedly said that this policy change is not a Res Life decision, and suggested senators talk to Vice President for Student Life Karnell McConnell-Black or Dean of Students Tawana Parks. Hickman did, however, say that she would like to see more student involvement and feedback in how Reed thinks about housing and housing policies, and she and senators also discussed Reed’s on-campus housing shortage for upperclassmen. Ratliff further clarified that the changes to the HA program will be the main topic at Senate public next week, and encouraged all those affected to attend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In committee reports, Senator Luiz Felipe Horta of the CSO Committee met with Community Safety Manager Christo Potgieter to discuss CSO turnover, student-CSO relations, and safety in the Student Union. Meanwhile, Office of Institutional Diversity liaisons will be meeting with Jessica Chia and Xixi Dukes on the 10th. A Title IX committee meeting will also be taking place on the 10th, and an update will be shared at public next week.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senators Astrid Liu, Luiz Felipe Horta, and Nina Gopaldas met with International Student Services Program Director Gwen Sandford to discuss the EXEL program and the current situation for international students applying for EXEL credits. Currently, international students earn two PE credits from completing the EXEL program, but students who have already completed all six of Reed’s required PE credits are “maxed out” and will need to contact the registrar’s office to apply for extra credits. Furthermore, senators discussed the concern held by some international students that companies may have been turning down job applications based on the incorrect assumption that hiring international students leads to extra costs and bureaucratic work for the company. As a solution, Sandford offered that any international students facing such obstacles should contact her, as she would be happy to sit down with a company and explain the process.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, tax season has begun for international students, and Gopaldas noted that all international students do have to file taxes in the US, even if they don’t work. Luckily, Reed provides a coupon code that will let international students file federal taxes online for free, although they will still have to pay for state taxes. International students should check their emails for more information sent out by Sandford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vice President Sean Brown attended a meeting with all of Reed’s accountability groups, which he described as “the first time that’s happened in a while,” and which served mainly as an introduction to the three groups: J-Board, RJ, and Honor Council. These groups are reportedly planning on unveiling an updated Honor Principle at Senate Public in 2-3 weeks, and Brown advised all to attend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reporting for the Academic Success Committee, President Safi Zenger shared that Dean of Students Tawana Parks has moved up their planned meeting, but it is unfortunately still during one of Zenger’s classes, so she has reached out to request a recap of meeting business after it takes place. “I haven’t been able to make it to that meeting in like a year,” said Zenger, “they just sort of forgot to invite us somewhere down the line.” Meanwhile, Zenger will be meeting with Christy Martin and Steve at Academic Support Services this Friday. Zenger also emailed her faculty advisor to get updated information on the Art Collection Committee, but he replied that he “forgot [he] was on that committee” and that they haven’t met for “a really long time.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New Student Body Assistant Treasurer Anahi Sanchez Marcial — AKA Baby Money — has scheduled a meeting with Director of Bookstore and Auxiliary Services Jessica Valeske, as well as joining Senator Meera Balan in meeting with the HCC. Meanwhile, Sanchez Marcial also attended the first meeting of the Student Committee on Diversity (SCOD), at which members discussed strategies for “making a more inclusive and safe HUM 110 experience for future Reedies.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leading Finance Committee, Head Treasurer Wani Pandey formally requested the allocation of $800 to House of Elvira, which was approved by unanimous vote. Pandey plans to meet with the Legislation Committee, the Reed Union, and the Renn Fayre czars in the near future, and hopes to debrief the Renn Fayre team about how Spring/Fall went. Both Pandey and Vice Treasurer Gopaldas urged students to vote in funding poll, which was released Monday, as soon as possible, while Pandey begged clubs to submit their budgets to Senate. “Clubs,” Pandey said, “please, <em>please</em> get your budgets in by 11:59 PM on Friday.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senator Meera Balan will be meeting with Senate Secretary and former Vice president Margot Becker to discuss social media for Senate, while also working alongside Senator Xixi Dukes to meet with Bon Appetite, regarding Balan’s campaign promises about Commons, and the director of the SEEDS program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senator Xixi Dukes reported that no progress has been made on the Conference and Events Planning Committee, citing a two-week old unanswered email to Assistant Director of Conference and Events Planning Megan Callero as the cause of the delay. <strong>[Correction: Senator Dukes misspoke and later corrected their statement — Ms. Callero did in fact respond to the email within 24 hours. The Quest apologizes for the error.]</strong> Dukes also expressed frustration regarding an unanswered email to Professor Paul Hovda about HUM 110, saying “he’s going to get an angry little girl on his doorstep tomorrow.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Audience member Ares Carnathan volunteered a question during new business, saying, “due to previous talk of things via previous senators who are now resigned, I heard things about choosing what names and where each name goes in IRIS and such. Do you have any updates on that?” Ratliff responded that that’s an issue they’d like to raise, alongside issues surrounding printing and Wi-Fi expansion.&nbsp;John, another audience member, volunteered an idea for Senate. “Last year,” John said, “in the wake of Paul Currie, we were talking to a lot of admin and faculty and trying to get things changed, and then there’d be some sort of gridlock and then we’d get people to tell their stories and we’d get a little progress, but it was exhausting to tell stories, so it would be nice to have a collection, maybe a website, where it could all be collected so we could give it to administrators.” Then, John explained, students wouldn’t have to relive unpleasant experiences whenever called upon, as they could simply send a link to the website to any administrator involved in discussions. John has built such a website, hosted at <a href="http://beingaminorityatreed.pages.dev">beingaminorityatreed.pages.dev</a>, and wanted to offer it to Senate. Brown called the demo website “bonkers,” and Zenger thanked John for coming forward, saying that Senate had wanted to do something like this for a long time but couldn’t because their webmaster quit. “You did this in five days,” Zenger said, “and we couldn’t do it in two and a half years, so I don’t know what that says about us,” to which another Senator responded, “it says we’re not computer-science majors,” to laughter from Senate and the audience.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The one-hit wonder layout editor Andrew Lucksinger is leaving their life of copying, pasting, forgetting to italicize “Quest,” and misspelling 1-5 words per issue for a glamorous semester across the pond. Avid <em>Quest</em> readers and those awake before 10am on Wednesdays who tune in to Jessie JRRC may be asking—could this have anything to do with Lucksinger’s potential British paramour? They won’t be the first to ask: <em>Daily Mail, Pink News</em>, and the <em>Mossy Log</em> have been hounding the SPO for weeks since they got wind of Lucksinger’s acceptance to the Freie Universität Berlin.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lucksinger superfans and various mailroom employees have noted large, glittery letters adorned with gold foil and stamps of British flags. Others have heard “Price Tag” blaring faintly from Lucksinger’s earbuds on the way to discuss Marx in ANTH 201. It seems long-distance is working out for the star-crossed lovers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sources say Jessie J, who has yet to release music since her seminal 2018 “This Christmas Day” album, has been waiting for a tour partner to kickstart her music career once more with a characteristic “Bang Bang.” Could this yet-unnamed collaborator be none other than the <em>Quest’s</em> own illustrious InDesigner?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, some fear that this blossoming romance and possible professional partnership may mask a deeper purpose for Lucksinger’s European sojourn: anonymous rumors have surfaced in the dark MCs that Lucksinger, following the Baby Money Pipeline, is on an international mission from Senate to test their capabilities for treasury. These allegations have the <em>Quest</em> asking, <em>is</em> it all about the money, money, money?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Baby Money Pipeline, a continual headache for the copy and content editors of the <em>Quest</em>, is the systematic betrayal of layout editors who leave the editorial board for Student Body Treasury. An international mission, though not a set precedent, may not be out of the question. But what could this mission be?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remarked Sabrina Blasik, “I still have no idea what it is about being a layout editor for the <em>Quest</em> that makes you qualified to handle the student body’s finances, but whatever it is, it has shortened my life expectancy by at least five years.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The loss of Nina Gopaldas, the Spring 2022 layout editor, has had particularly tragic consequences for Quest copy and content editor Madeleine Voth. Now that Gopaldas has gone, Voth is left to bear the brunt of fellow Quest editor Anie Kotha’s sadistic ridicule.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s like, I didn’t even do anything to deserve it! I even sort of cleaned the SPO for the first time in who knows how many years! I opened the Untouchable Fridge! And Anie <em>still</em> keeps trying to convince everyone to quit so I’m the only editor left,” huffed Voth.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s not like I throw things at her,” scoffed Kotha upon questioning. “Nina had it way worse.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve long been suspicious of Andrew’s possible future in Treasury,” said <em>Quest</em> editor Sabrina Blasik. “First Wani, then Nina? Who’s to say it stops there? Why wouldn’t Andrew want to stay up into the wee hours of the morning hunched over Adobe InDesign? We listen to Mamma Mia for Christ’s sake!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Quest editor Anie Kotha came to similar conclusions. “Conveniently leaving after just one semester? To go to <em>Germany</em>?? I don’t buy it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There have been mysterious dollar signs embedded in articles,” shared <em>Quest</em> editor Madeleine Voth. “They claim it’s because they hit the shift key on accident, but I’m not so sure. Could sleep deprived typos really be the only thing behind the symbols?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Quest editor Cass Biles, it all comes down to the money. “This may have started way back when we couldn’t figure out how to get paid for the first month. Maybe they decided they had to get to the source—to get that cold, hard cash.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <em>Quest’s</em> suspicions were only furthered when Senate Beat reporter Declan Bradley alleged that during a recent Senate Public, Treasurers openly acknowledged and discussed in depth their plans to recruit Lucksinger. However, given that no one attends Senate Public, there were no other witnesses to confirm this account.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When asked what Lucksinger could possibly be doing for Treasury in Berlin, the editorial board immediately launched into an elaborate whiteboard marker map of possibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s gotta be a slush fund,” insisted editor Cass Biles. “They once tried to make editorial staff BET on the Senate election outcomes. We didn’t agree to it of course, we’re upstanding citizens, but if we had… I’d bet my firstborn they would have rigged it in their favor. Lucksinger is too quiet to be anything but a schemer.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“No way,” interjected Kotha. “You think they’d go all the way just for that? [anie’s theory]</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blasik, who had been sitting in the back of the meeting with her fingers steepled like an evil villain, spoke up. “I think I know what’s going on. Hear me out—it all comes back to Beer Nation.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those unaware, why aren’t you reading the <em>Quest</em>?? Beer Nation initially received 0.5% of their requested funds from Senate at the beginning of this fall due to past signators being “funny with money.” Is Senate holding onto their grudge and sending Lucksinger for Oktoberfest surveillance?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Current Baby Money, and former <em>Quest</em> Layout editor Nina Gopaldas, has refused comment, citing anything from plausible deniability to urgent poem memorization as reasons for avoiding interviews.&nbsp;</p>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The YDSA club organizes campaigns, rallies, speaker events, and more — but what is it?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, the club is a chapter of the Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA), a version of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) specifically geared towards high school and college students. There have been a few different versions of the YDSA at Reed over the years, but the current one was established in 2021. The club has participated in national DSA events, such as helping to organize the Reproductive Rights Day of Action last semester, in conjunction with the national DSA day of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DSA is a widely varying institution, with many different facets and branches of socialism coming together under the banner of the DSA in order to pursue shared goals. “It's not that I agree with everything that national leadership says and does, it's because we have the most potential as an organization to enact change,” says Spencer Mann, one of the chair members of the YDSA club on campus. “DSA is not a political monolith.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a group advocating for social justice and change, it is important to ensure different perspectives and voices are included — and at a predominantly white institution (PWI), it’s especially important that marginalized voices are heard. Working with this awareness, the YDSA club implements a strategy called “progressive stacking.” In order to contribute to a discussion, members join a “stack” and wait for their turn to speak. With progressive stacking, layers of marginalization and identities are factored into the speaking time for the individual, allowing people from more marginalized groups to have a greater voice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fact does not change, however, that Reed is a PWI. “It’s important to avoid tokenization,” says Mann, “we don’t want to put an increased burden on people or marginalized identities to fill roles that they might not have time to or want to participate in.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For new members uncertain whether they know enough to contribute, Mann says not to worry. “It’s a totally open environment, most people are just beginning their journey into socialist politics,” they said, “People are really coming from all different experiences.” There is no required reading level to attend the meetings, though there are reading groups available to join within the club itself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Mann, the club promotes learning by doing. “We want people to get in there and try out new things – whether that’s speaking up in a meeting or talking to people on campus about socialism.” Club meetings typically consist of reading groups, political discussions, and the occasional speaker from Portland DSA, or the broader socialist movement. The debates, Spencer says, “are tied to tangible actions and meaning.”<br>If you’re interested in checking out the YDSA, the group hosts open meetings every Thursday at 7pm in PAB room 332. You can reach out to them on Twitter (@YDSAReed), Instagram (@reed_ydsa), or by email at <a href="mailto:reedcollegeydsa@gmail.com">reedcollegeydsa@gmail.com</a>.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Editor's note: As with all Letters to the Editor submitted to the Reed College Quest, this letter does not reflect the views or positions of the Quest, its writers, or its editors. We understand the journalistic pitfalls of sensationalism, and our intentions are not to provoke a response, especially around such a serious and painful matter. We believe that, regardless of personal opinion, newspapers have a responsibility to publish submissions that they receive, and that editors should strive to adhere to publication policies regardless of their personal beliefs on an issue. In light of that, we have made the decision to publish this letter, which was written and sent to the Quest unsolicited by Reed alumnus David Comfort (‘71), as it is compliant with our current bylaws and policies as outlined on our website. These bylaws may be updated in the future.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We recognize that this letter may be upsetting to some readers, and are choosing to run it under a</em><strong><em> trigger warning for the following subjects: discussion of Paul Currie; racial insensitivity.</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Quest editors,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last March, a video was posted on TikTok and Twitter showing Reed Professor Paul Currie at a fast-food restaurant window asking whether two employees, whom he called “rude,” were born in the US.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 28-second clip shows no rants, racist or otherwise. Also missing is the alleged rude employee behavior which may have triggered the incident. Absent too is the confrontation climax. According to the Willamette News: “The video captures only part of what appears to be a longer exchange…. [It] ends just as another person comes to Currie’s passenger window and threatens to “break all of your motherf*cking windows.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Based on a video with the beginning and end redacted, Reed’s YDSA chapter stated: "Paul's actions uphold white supremacy and American chauvinism by insinuating that someone's immigration status determines their value as a worker and as a human being." YDSA led other students on a march on the President’s office, chanting: “Fire Currie! Fuck Curie!” Meanwhile, on 4/2/22, The Quest claimed Currie had “hurled racial epithets”; then it condemned the administration for “insufficient response” to the professor’s nonexistent “despicable and racist statements.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, Reed launched an immediate investigation. Afterward, President Bilger announced that “no violation of college policy” had been found. Moreover, 112 faculty members (of 162) refused to sign a termination-demand letter from complainants. <em>[Editor’s note: This is, at best, a misinterpretation: as reported by </em>the Quest <em>last April, the letter was described as “spontaneous” by those who wrote it, and at least some interested faculty were not made aware of its existence until after it had already been submitted.]</em> Currie released his own statement to the student body, expressing his “commitment to diversity,” and confessing his “intense shame and regret.” He concluded: “I understand that I must work hard to restore your faith in me.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though never once in his Reed tenure had a complaint – racial or otherwise -- been lodged against Currie, his critics seemed to regard him as no different than a David Duke. Thus: no second chances, no forgiveness. No censure, no probation. Since the professor expressed hope of staying on and regaining student faith, one can only conclude that the administration demanded his resignation to appease his accusers enraged by a misleading, edited video. The Scarlet Letter “R” now erases his PhD: his professional life may be ruined.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1954, Reed fired tenured Philosophy professor, Stanley Moore, for refusing to confess his alleged Marxist sympathies to the McCarthy UnAmerican Activity Committee. In 1981, thanks to the efforts of two students, the board of trustees apologized and welcomed “him into the company of former faculty members on the same basis as if his departure had been entirely voluntary.''</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/31/us/college-apologizes-to-professor-for-1954-dismissal.html">https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/31/us/college-apologizes-to-professor-for-1954-dismissal.html</a>)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the students, Michael Munk (later a Rutgers prof, now deceased), called Moore’s firing “a black mark on Reed’s record.” But, after the board’s reversal, he celebrated: “A black mark has been erased… McCarthyism has ended!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I attended Reed, it was all about open dialog, diverse opinion, and above all Reason -- not distortion of facts and suppression of debate in the service of vindictive emotion. I am as vehement an opponent of Racism as anyone. But, in my wildest dreams, I never thought Reed would violate its commitment to impartial reason and fair play by surrendering to punitive political fanaticism.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sincerely,<br>David Comfort (Reed Class of ’71)</p>

<p>As reported in Senate Beat in September, Senate has cited student sentiment as a primary motivator for their decision to withdraw funding from the Restorative Justice program. The decision-making process, Senate has stated, has been “informed by feedback from students who say that participating in Restorative Justice feels “weird” and “uncomfortable,” due to the fact that the organization’s activities are rooted in indigenous practices in a way that some students find appropriative.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As part of our research on this issue, we ask that readers please take five minutes to fill out the anonymous survey below to help us understand the history of student experiences with RJ.</p>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Collapsed gymnasium to be rebuilt by fall of 2024</em></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two long years after the collapse of Reed’s sports center, reconstruction of the building is set to begin any day now. The new gym is scheduled to be finished by August of 2024 and offers many new, exciting amenities.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michael Lombardo, Director of Athletics, Fitness, and Outdoor Programs, states that the new building will offer all the activities provided before the collapse, and <em>then some! </em>Lombardo also emphasizes that the main focus while designing the new gym was to cultivate an inclusive and friendly environment that prioritized student wellness. He states that from the very beginning, the new gym’s design is about “more accessibility, easier ADA access, and just a more inviting, easy to maneuver around environment.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new building will host a large gymnasium allowing indoor basketball, volleyball, pickleball, and badminton. In addition, the building will also have two “multipurpose venues,” which, as their name implies, will be able to accommodate a variety of activities: martial arts, yoga, pilates, wellness classes, and potentially many more.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, the gym will host a new lounge area in front of the current Outdoor Center, where students can relax and play table tennis, a sport that used to be offered as a PE class. When the gym collapsed in 2021, all the table tennis tables were destroyed, but the new gym’s lounge will be equipped with seven new tables.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conjunction with the gym’s construction, the sports center will also be remodeled, specifically the locker rooms. With the new design, there will be an additional gender-non-exclusive changing and shower area with a sauna included.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is important to note that the current sports center has one small all-gender locker room, as well as two all-gender bathrooms, and patrons are encouraged to use whichever locker/shower room they feel most comfortable with. Saunas at this time are divided by the Men’s and Women’s locker rooms.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The location of the cage will also change, and by the end of the construction, it will be located on the main level next to what currently is the dance studio. This will improve accessibility, and with its location next to the elevator, will hopefully be more accommodating to students with disabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While construction is happening, students may expect noise, especially with initial demolitions. There will also be blocked-off areas to separate construction workers and patrons, and temporary walls will restrict some areas in the current Sports Center. Certain entrances may also be blocked off, so students should be on the lookout for signs indicating which entrance they should use. Additionally, some areas such as the cardio room or the locker rooms may be fully inaccessible while the construction is going on. As Steve Yeadon, Director of Facilities Operations states “How people using the space will access the area will change from time to time throughout the construction process. There will be points in time where some existing services may not be available for weeks or maybe a couple months.” Lombardo adds that “There is going to be a good amount of disruption for the next year and a half, I’m going to try as hard as I can to keep the sports center open for patron access as possible … I am asking the community to be understanding and flexible”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yeadon also notes that the West Parking Lot is likely to become much more congested as construction progresses, and urges students who park there to be mindful of the space, and aware of the approaching influx of construction vehicles.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite this temporary inconvenience, Lombardo advises students to focus on the exciting end goal of a new and improved Reed gymnasium. He states that “While the previous sports center was charming and cozy, it was dated,” and, “a little bit more off-putting for students that maybe don’t feel quite comfortable exercising … I think this new building will be a lot warmer, much more inviting, and just aesthetically more attractive.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lombardo also urges students to think of the gym as a relaxing place to have fun and connect outside of a classroom or library setting. He emphasizes that PE classes are meant to help students take a break from the daily monotony of academic rigor, and allow them to focus on their physical and mental wellness in addition to their classes. He states that under the AFOP (Athletic, Fitness, and Outdoor programs), “student enjoyment, fitness, and skill learning are emphasized; competition is not.” PE classes are aimed to “provide options for students to manage stress in a healthy and constructive way, help students learn positive lifestyle skills, provide an environment that encourages a holistic approach to life and, hopefully, to unwind a bit and just have some fun!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Under these principles of inclusivity, wellness, and accessibility, the new gym hopes to honor all the goals of Lombardo and the rest of the AFOP staff. As Yeadon states, “The original building was built in 1964, and they probably had much different needs than we do now for wellness and health.” While the collapse of the old gym was difficult, and construction will pose some inconveniences, Lombardo encourages students to view the new gym as “lemonade out of lemons,” and that “the reconstruction and opening of the remodeled sports center will be a fantastic opportunity to rethink how we will use this space in the future as a center that is inclusive, relevant and community-building.” Lombardo also heavily values student feedback, so if you have any questions or criticisms, please feel free to email him at <a href="mailto:lombardm@reed.edu">lombardm@reed.edu</a>.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Administration Announces Changes to the HA Application]]></title>
		<link>https://reedquest.org/2023/02/17/administration-announces-changes-to-the-ha-application/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On January 13, 2023, the returning House Advisor applications went live on Handshake. Along with structural revisions, there were two big changes to the application that caused a ruckus among many current HAs. The application, along with all the regular HA duties such as throwing events, being available for training dates, etc., introduced two new guidelines which caught us all off guard. In order to be an HA at Reed, a GPA requirement has been instated, as well as a requirement to be “on-call” during the school year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of these changes were a surprise not only to the student body but also to ResLife itself. Only days before the applications went live, Associate Dean for Student and Campus Life Claudia Ramirez Islas informed ResLife of the changes that had been made to the HA role. This was shocking to ResLife, especially considering that they already had an HA application to release during winter break, but were continuously told to push the date.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many HAs and area coordinators gathered on February 13 to air their grievances about the new role, particularly with concern about the logistics of these new requirements. Hailey Fazio (‘24) spoke on how the HA job is now less attainable because of the new GPA requirement (now 2.4, though 2.5 when the application first dropped). She asserted that, “Just because someone's GPA dips under 2.5 does not mean that they are unable to be an HA…it's a crazy thing that someone may be terminated because they may have not done as well” Fazio was also concerned with how on-call training will work. Max Costigan (‘25) pointed out that many HAs did not even attend training because they were occupied with other commitments. They questioned how this problem would be remedied; If training becomes required, especially with the new first-aid certification, how will the administration accommodate students who are unable to attend all of the training? This mandatory training could force students to decide between things such as struggling to afford off-campus housing, or missing crucial internship opportunities, a decision that is incredibly hard to make, especially for lower-income students. Ashley Oliver ‘25 read aloud a quote from the “Vision &amp; Values” section of ResLife’s website, “<em>We envision a vibrant, safe, inclusive living environment where each student is invested in their academic and personal success and their pride in Reed. These values include academic excellence, community, personal development, respect, and wellness.</em>” Oliver then asked, “Do you think keeping students on call on nights and weekends facilitates their academic excellence? What about their personal development? Or wellness?” They continued, saying, “Any equitable employer asking their employee to do more work would offer them more pay.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ashley Schlipp (‘25) posed a question about how applicants — which includes returning HAs — are expected to decide if they want to continue with their application, as many of the logistics of on-call are not yet laid out. Considering that many have multiple jobs, an overload of classes, and off-campus responsibilities, it would be incredibly hard for potential applicants to decide whether to apply without more details.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Do you think keeping students on call on<br>nights and weekends facilitates their academic<br>excellence? What about their personal<br>development? Or wellness?”</p><cite><em>- Ashley Oliver ‘25</em></cite></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately, this Senate public gave few answers to those who attended. The meeting ended with Dean of Students Tawana Parks asserting, “I heard all of your voices. I’m incredibly honored that you shared them.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After speaking with Gary Granger, students were told that CSOs are aware of the HA role changes, and officers have spoken amongst themselves as to how these revisions may affect campus safety or security. Overall, Director of Community Safety Gary Granger stated that they “look forward to collaborating with Residence Life by ensuring that CSO roles and HA roles are synchronous and, to the extent possible, that we don't duplicate work.” Despite this future collaboration, no concrete plans have been set in place. At the end of Senate public, Parks stated that Vice President for Student Life Karnell McConnell-Black has been working on implementing these guidelines for the past two years. However, some staff stated that despite the HA revisions being a two-year plan, they were not informed of these new guidelines, and the changes came as a surprise.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Upon further research, Willamette University’s on-call position held incredibly similar descriptions to the one at Reed College. Their RA description reads, “Serve in an on-call rotation during the semester; on-call is scheduled to cover when most campus offices (e.g., Residence Life and Housing) are not open. On-call RAs are often the first layer of response to needs including but not limited to lockouts, medical emergencies, and facility problems. RAs are expected to contact additional support resources for resolution as needed.” This description was exactly translated onto Reed’s HA application, the only difference being that RA was switched to HA in Reed’s version, and Willamette University had already established on-call times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was also discovered that the GPA Housing Advisor requirements and responsibilities are similar to Reed’s at both Willamette University and Lewis and Clark College. Both institutions require a GPA of 2.5 at the time of hiring, while similarly, Reed requires a GPA of 2.4. Current HAs at Senate public commented that this GPA requirement opposed the deemphasis of grades that Reed so proudly abides by. As per Reed’s grade policy, “Students are encouraged to focus on learning, not on grades. Students receive extensive feedback on their work, and semester grades are filed with the registrar, but, by tradition, students do not receive standard grade reports.” Students point out that with this requirement on the HA application, grades now become a factor as to why one deserves to be an HA.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As many HAs have seen in the past, the application process previously included cover letters and applicant interviews. However, last year these two processes were removed in order to make the position more equitable for students. This year, they were reinstated for new applicants by the administration.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <em>Quest</em> has reached out to administration with questions regarding changes in the HA job description and more, but has been unable to receive answers at this time. As a result, this is an ongoing piece, so check back with the <em>Quest</em> later for more!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the afternoon of Tuesday, February 7, Ash Auer received an email from the Admissions Office stating that Vice President and Dean of Admission and Financial Aid Milyon Trulove had “requested to meet with [her] as soon as possible.” Ash was an auditor — a non-traditional student who pays a flat rate of $100 to sit in on a single Reed class per semester, with the permission of that class’s professor. As auditors, students like Ash do not pay tuition or apply through the normal admissions and background check process, but their coursework is not graded and they cannot receive credit for the courses they take. As a result, the audit program is often most appealing to low-income students like Ash, who has cited her financial situation and academic history as two reasons that full transfer admission to Reed would not be viable for her.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an interview with the <em>Quest</em>, Ash stated that her initial reaction to the email was, “Okay, he's head of financial aid, I thought he was going to encourage me to become a degree-seeking student at Reed, rather than one who was participating through the audit program.” However, this did not prove to be the case. At the meeting, which reportedly took place at 2:30 PM on Wednesday, February 8, and lasted for about an hour, Mr. Trulove informed Ash that she was being removed from the audit program and confiscated her student ID. “Mr. Trulove informed me that because I had abused access to school resources and spaces, I was being immediately withdrawn from the audit program, and the course in which I was enrolled,” Ash said, “He then demanded that I give him my student ID and informed me that I was no longer allowed to access campus facilities.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While Ash has stated that this Wednesday afternoon meeting was her only interaction with the admissions office regarding her auditing status, Mr. Trulove, who is legally bound not to reveal the specifics of the case, has maintained in general terms that, in cases of expulsion over abuse of resources, students always receive multiple communications and warnings before the final decision is made. Mr. Trulove has further cited the Reed policy on auditors (<a href="https://www.reed.edu/catalog/admission/admission.html">https://www.reed.edu/catalog/admission/admission.html</a>) as having informed the department’s decision on Ash’s case, stating that this document is an “affirmative policy” which lays out all of the things that auditors can do, and that, by default, anything not on the list, such as participating in student groups, is something that auditors cannot do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When a group of students gathered for a sit-in at the admissions office on Tuesday to protest Ash’s alleged treatment, Mr. Trulove stated that, “If there's any case where an auditor does run into an area of breaching into something [that] they cannot do, then we would speak with the auditor and let them know and inform them, we would affirm with them that they understood the policy that they had breached. And so that would be the very first action, … one of our administrators would reach out to that person and have a conversation with them. And they would come to an agreement in that conversation that continuing to breach a policy is not appropriate, and that if they continue to, it may jeopardize [their] position as an auditor.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While Mr. Trulove has stated that, for reasons of confidentiality, he is not legally able to speak about any of the specific details of Ash’s case, he and other admissions staff present at the sit-in seemed to imply that those present may not have been aware of the full details of Ash’s situation. In conversation with the <em>Quest</em>, Ash confirmed that she had requested that she be given an official reed.edu email address shortly before September 22nd, 2022, supposedly with the help of her professor at the time. According to Ash, this request was initially approved, but, on September 21st, she received an email from Admissions Fellow Bahar Tarighi stating that the email had been granted in error. Ms. Tarighi wrote that, “I spoke to my team and we discovered that auditors are not eligible for reed [sic] accounts, the email you got from CUS was for us to submit your information for swipe access. You should be using your personal email address for communication with professors, no reed [sic] email is necessary for audit purposes.” Ash’s email account was reportedly closed shortly thereafter. In a subsequent phone call Ash placed to the admissions office, she spoke with an admissions professional she believed to be Ms. Tarighi, although she could not confirm the name. At that time, this admissions professional reportedly informed Ash that “participation in student-run organizations was not a feature of the audit program.” This conversation would have taken place “shortly after September 30th,” although Ash was unable to provide an exact date.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reflecting on this conversation, Ash stated that she had not understood this statement to be a declaration of college policy. “At the time,” Ash said, “this just seemed to be them not wanting to go through the trouble of setting up an email account so I could more easily join those organizations, rather than this being an official policy process.” However, during the Wednesday afternoon meeting with Ash, Mr. Trulove allegedly cited this September phone call as evidence that Ash was aware of the college’s policy regarding auditing students’ participation in campus groups and had “deliberately disobeyed an admissions staff member.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Ash, at some point later in the first semester, the same unnamed professor who had been involved in her request for a campus email reportedly contacted the OneCard corporation — an outside company to which Reed outsources its swipe system — to request that Ash’s card be given access to the on-campus Pride Center, bypassing the Admissions Office in the process. Ash’s card was granted access to the Pride Center soon after, and Ash suggested in conversation with the <em>Quest</em> that her use of the Pride Center and other student spaces, alongside her leadership of student groups like the Queer Student Union (QSU) and her use of the Reed library, factored into the decision to revoke her auditor status.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr. Trulove, however, has denied the assertion that Ash’s use of the Reed library was a factor in the decision to remove her from the audit program, saying “I haven’t had conversations about the library and access or exclusion as a result of access to the library. And so I understand the line of thinking, but that's not been part of any conversations that I've had.” When one of the students present at the February 14th sit-in contradicted this, saying “our conversations with Ash have indicated otherwise,” Mr. Trulove seemed about to respond, but ceded the floor when another student started to speak, starting a tangent discussion that continued for several minutes. Later, however, he reiterated the college’s official policy for dismissing students from the audit program, saying, “In any situation where it will be a student's status may change, what we would do in that circumstance or any similar circumstances, that student would know, well ahead of their circumstances changing, if there is a situation evident. So we have a process, speaking with students and giving them an update on a certain circumstance, we have a process of investigating, we have a process of giving the students information, so they provide us information just in case we've missed something. So while I can't comment on this particular case, I want you to know that this is a process in college admission that we really take seriously. And that it is not a one-step process.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When asked if he could provide Ash with a complete, written list of reasons for her removal from campus, Mr. Trulove responded in general terms that Reed’s written policy on withdrawal of admission indicates that “we may or may not let a student know why we've changed their student status.” While he reiterated that he legally could not discuss the specifics of Ash’s case, when asked in what situation a student would not know why their status was revoked, Mr. Trulove stated, “So I want to say this, this is not intended to be talking about this particular situation. … So I want to be clear that whatever I'm saying, I'm not trying to indirectly apply this to Ash. Is that clear? <em>[general nods of agreement]</em> Okay, so off the top of my head, if I thought it might reveal something about a different individual. If I thought that the reason was complicated enough that maybe the student may not be aware of this. If I thought that there are these circumstances about communication that weren't going to be particularly effective. … But that's just what the decision says. And that's fairly standard in admission. And so it's basically a cookie cutter sort of form that's out there, you'll see that with many colleges. And so those are some ways and reasons in which we might not let someone know. But again, it's a standard policy and I want to make sure that you're aware of this so that I can set expectations on the policy.” This statement was consistent with Ash’s account of her meeting with Mr. Trulove on Wednesday afternoon, during which she reportedly asked him “whether there was anything other than what was stated that I did wrong,” to which Mr. Trulove allegedly again responded that he was unable to answer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the last minutes of the sit-in on Tuesday afternoon, students read aloud a list of demands that included, for auditors, “the ability to participate in student-run organizations, swipe card access to all academic buildings, the library, and GCC student spaces, a Reed email address, Moodle access by default, the ability to use printers on campus, the ability to audit more than two classes per academic year, and access to an advisor.” Students further demanded that “the rules for auditing students' protections be put into documentation and made accessible to viewers,” that “a democratically elected body of students be given oversight over the selection, hiring, and firing of all college administrators, and that the selection processes for college administrators occur in a manner that is transparent and accountable to the student body.” The group’s printed list of demands also included that “Trulove resign or be removed from his position immediately,” although some students seemed hesitant to say that with Mr. Trulove present, saying only that he should face “consequences” for his involvement in Ash’s case.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Students further cited a 2018 <em>Quest</em> article which provides information on a 2014 Title IX case brought by Andrea Hendrickson, a senior admissions counselor who accused Mr. Trulove of sexual harassment. To this day some of the details of that case remain unclear or confidential, and an internal Title IX Board presided over by then Reed President John Kroger ultimately concluded that “while Trulove had clearly engaged in inappropriate behavior, it did not rise to the level of sexual harassment.” While Trulove was reportedly “sanctioned for his actions,” the decision still apparently “shocked many staff members in the Admission Office, who believed Hendrickson’s account of events to be credible.” For more information, see <a href="https://reedquest.org/2019/04/26/2019-4-26-an-untenable-workplace/">https://reedquest.org/2019/04/26/2019-4-26-an-untenable-workplace/</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While some students in attendance at the sit-in seemed satisfied with Mr. Trulove’s proposal that they provide a list of demands and that he reply with an official response within a week, others are seemingly unwilling to wait. At a meeting to discuss future plans on Wednesday night, a student read aloud from a statement, reportedly written by Ash, that described the group’s current actions as a “war of attrition,” and outlined a list of potential strategies for moving forward that included applying pressure to the Reed parents’ Facebook group, asking parents to call college administration to complain, sending emails to private high school college advisors, discouraging donors from giving money to Reed, general “disruption of student events,” and taking unspecified further actions to “cost the school money and disrupt enrollment.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, this does not necessarily reflect the views of all students who attended the sit-in. Soap Khan, for example, stated that their primary aim at this stage was to pursue “holding Milyon Trulove accountable in student Senate.” When asked about the potential strategies outlined above, Khan seemed to express some surprise, and said that “those are certainly strategies of protest, those are not necessarily parts of our plan now, but if need be, if the staff here at Reed College do not work with us, I can see how that might be a possibility, but it’s not directly in our plans.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a written statement to the <em>Quest</em>, as in his statements during the sit-in, Mr. Trulove emphasized that there are multiple ways for students to engage with the Reed community. “Every year approximately 20 auditors enjoy courses with Reed faculty and students,” Mr. Trulove wrote, “Most often, they are retirees who are neighbors to the college and occasionally transfer eligible students. Our auditing policy and level of access are typical. The program is priced more affordably than other colleges and universities that charge the same as the credit-bearing courses — tuition by credit. There are several ways for individuals to participate in the Reed classroom — as an auditor, through the Young Scholars high school program, by taking a credit-bearing course, or as an enrolled student. Student activities are limited to enrolled students who pay the student fee. There are other campus services that are limited to students who pay tuition.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some students, however, are beginning to discuss issues wider than Ash’s situation. Speaking at the Tuesday sit-in, Khan said that, “It's not simply the situation of Ash, but also now we're seeing all of these systematic issues with the school in particular, and the ability for people to be protected in their access to education here. But then … it also made us realize that there's a lack of power that students have, to be able to have any say in these sorts of changes being made. Like the process with people like [Paul] Currie, … that sort of a situation, it took an extremely, extremely long period of time for anything to happen. … But … if we were to want to … make the demands for auditing students to get the rights as they do at other colleges, like … the ability to participate in student run organizations, swipe card access, etc. … protections being put into a document that's made readily accessible to viewers. … We really think that it'd be extremely valuable at this school, to be able to make demands like that and set the process of putting them into effect. [To] have that be something that students can take part in, especially when … prior things have happened, where students have felt, frankly, powerless, and … the school doesn't necessarily care about what they have to say, right? … This situation is stressful for us …, definitely, it's especially stressful for Ash, it affects people. And I think that I want you all to recognize that, and actually allow us to make some changes to the school for the better and inclusion of everybody, especially when we're the ones who are paying for everything here.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In response, Mr. Trulove and other admissions staff assured those present that they welcome student feedback and take such input seriously. “In my mind, that doesn't have to be a demand,” Mr. Trulove said, “It's a conversation, like you coming here and saying that, hey, these things don't work. I have office hours every week that are open to the student body. And … many of the changes we made to our deposit fee — being able to adjust it — to how we present our essay, [and] how we are giving people access to campus, have all been initiated by students. … We might not come to the exact same decision,” Mr. Trulove said, “but I am committed to having this conversation to make this college better.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the <em>Quest</em> has done its best to report these events in full, much about this story remains unclear. Given that these events are ongoing, and we were unable to get in touch with several parties who have some connection to the story, the <em>Quest</em> anticipates that we will be publishing further coverage as we learn more. Stay tuned for further stories in the coming weeks.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exhibition: Dark Moves</strong><strong> (Feb 17th - 19th, 12:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. @ Cooley Art Gallery)</strong></h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Douglas F. Cooley Memorial Art Gallery, Reed College, is proud to present Dark Moves: Fabiola Menchelli &amp; Heather Watkins. This intimate exhibition consists of newly-commissioned work by Mexico City artist Fabiola Menchelli and Northwest artist Heather Watkins.&nbsp; Nestled in the Reed College library, the gallery is free and open to the public. Families are welcome!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Menchelli and Watkins are artists deeply invested in the sensory and perceptual possibilities of light—along with its orbital complements, darkness and shadow. With artistic methodologies drawn from poetry, cosmogony, and scientific experimentation, the artists modulate the luminal in pursuit of unknown outcomes. Resultant forms of disappearance, reversal, and refraction communicate across the entirety of the Cooley—particularly in the center, where a hexagonal room with open ends echoes the internal angles and shadows of Menchelli and Watkins’ work.​​ As viewers move through, and around, the hexagon, their bodies draw the symbol of the lemniscate—the infinity symbol (∞). Dark Moves seeks to emulate the ways that shadow becomes a medium in the artists’ hands—contouring, obscuring, and unfolding their work across the deep, azure walls of the museum.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Menchelli and Watkins employ color, line, and saturation—dematerializing modernist geometries, and transforming planarity into ascending angles and curves. Their experiments produce enigmatic effects and lacunae—voids and folds that touch and trace one another. In Dark Moves, Menchelli brings new dimensionality to her translucent color photograms, made entirely in the dark—folding and manipulating the photosensitive paper. These alchemical agents become embodied sculptures mounted on a stainless steel substructure that thrust their geometric volumes, casting shadows on the wall. In the darkened surroundings of the space, Watkins transforms the dynamic linearity of her ink-based drawings into rising, swooping organic forms that radiate wild shadows. These sculptural forms accompany numinous gold reliefs created by imperceptible forces, and small works on paper that oscillate between a fluid lyricism and darker visions of interior compression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the last two years, the artists and the curator have engaged in an extensive collaborative process, working between Portland and Mexico City. This ongoing conversation has shaped every aspect of the exhibition and its extended programing, including the forthcoming catalog by Mexico City designer Priscila Vanneuville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Dark Moves, seeing is not believing. Here, to “see” is to search for ways of knowing that may only be accessed through shadow, the subconscious, and the ancient iconographies of pleasure and pain at the heart of the visual imagination.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Heather Watkins holds an MFA from the Rhode Island School of Design, and a dual BA in English &amp; World Literature and Classical Studies, from Pitzer College (Claremont, CA).

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Biology Seminar: Dr. Clark Knight</strong><strong> (4:10 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. @ Psychology 105)</strong></h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Historical role of fire in the Klamath Mountains, California</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this talk, USGS scientist <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/clarke-knight">Dr. Clarke Knight</a> will discuss a recent paper which found strong Indigenous influence on forest conditions in the Klamath Mountains over one millennium. She co-authored this research with members of the Karuk and Yurok Tribes, USGS scientists, and USFS scientists. Their findings show that a fire regime consisting of tribal burning practices and lightning ignitions was associated with long-term stability of forest biomass. Before Euro-American colonization, the long-term median forest biomass was approximately half of contemporary values. Indigenous depopulation and 20th-century fire suppression likely allowed biomass to increase, culminating in the current landscape: a closed Douglas fir–dominant forest unlike any seen in the preceding 3,000 years. This is consistent with pre-contact forest conditions being influenced by Indigenous land management and suggests large-scale interventions could be needed to return to historic forest biomass levels.</p>

<p><strong>A Categorical Introduction to Sheaf Theory -</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sheaf theory is a subject which deals with converting local solutions on a topological space into global solutions. Sheaves help us find a way to "glue" together the local solutions to a problem in order to find a global solution which still conforms to the topology of the space. Arising from complex analysis, sheaf theory has found applications across mathematics in algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, differential geometry, and even mathematical logic. In this talk I will introduce the basic ideas of category theory which will be used to discuss some of the foundational concepts in sheaf theory. We will discuss both sheaves and étale spaces and walk through the proof of their equivalence. Time permitting, we may also look at some interesting applications of sheaf theory in objects like algebraic sheaves, stacks, or topoi. No previous knowledge of category theory will be assumed.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last Thursday, February 9, Kevan M. Shokat, Ph.D., Reed Class of 1986, received the Vollum Award for Distinguished Accomplishment in Science and Technology at an event held in Vollum Lecture Hall, hosted by President Bilger and introduced by Biology Professor Janis Shamplay. This was the first Vollum Award ceremony held since 2018. According to a pamphlet handed out before the event, the Vollum Award was created in 1975 to honor the late Reed alum and trustee C. Howard Vollum. The award is “intended to recognize and celebrate the exceptional achievement of a member of the scientific and technical community of the Pacific Northwest.” Dr. Shokat, as the newest award recipient, will be in the company of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, the latter being a famously brief Reed student. Dr. Shokat himself is now a professor of cellular and molecular pharmacology at the University of California, San Francisco, and a professor of chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, as well as an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following the award presentation, Dr. Shokat gave an in-depth lecture on the research he and his lab team have been doing for the better part of a decade, and the pioneering medical breakthroughs they’ve accomplished in the process. This work has been published not only in medical journals, but also in a recent <em>New York Times</em><em> </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/health/lung-cancer-drug.html">article</a> which details all that they have discovered. Dr. Shokat began his talk by explaining why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat, primarily arguing that finding drugs that affect only cancer cells can be incredibly challenging. He explained that the body has mechanisms to stop cancer cell proliferation, specifically the TP53 gene, a type of tumor suppressor gene that can halt cancer cell replication. However, the TP53 gene can often mutate itself and lose its tumor suppressor function, allowing tumor growth to continue. While Dr. Shokat did speak briefly about potential drugs that may be able to “rescue” the TP53 suppressor function, he revealed that his lab’s research was primarily dedicated to blocking the function of the KRAS gene, from which the G12C mutation causes more than 1 in 10 lung cancers worldwide, as well as many colorectal and pancreatic cancers. The goal of Dr. Shokat and his lab was to discover a drug-compatible molecule that could block KRAS function, which would significantly challenge a tumor’s ability to grow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Shokat’s work was built off of decades of research targeting KRAS mutations. Starting in 1983 there was an effort to block KRAS membrane localization, which proved initially promising but ultimately failed, and was shut down in the late 1990s. Dr Shokat’s team, after years of searching, found a molecule that could form an irreversible covalent bond with the amino acid cysteine, which occurs only in mutated KRAS genes. Dr. Shokat expressed elation at this discovery, as the uniqueness of cysteine’s presence in the mutated KRAS gene allowed for exactly the kind of specifically targeted drug cancer researchers look for: a drug that will only affect cancer cell function, without causing other harmful side effects. Two drugs were initially approved, sotorasib in 2021 and adagrasib in 2022. Based on a graph of preliminary clinical results for the drugs, approximately 80% of lung cancer patients saw some amount of tumor shrinkage after taking the medication, but Dr. Shokat insists that there is considerable room for improvement. There are now more than ten cysteine-binding drugs on the market or in clinical trials today.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the discovery of a cysteine binder, Dr. Shokat’s team moved on to look for molecules that would bind to other amino acids found in mutated KRAS genes, such as serine and arginine, which are both significantly harder to affect due to their less reactive chemical structures compared to cysteine. It took his team ten more years to find a serine binder. Dr. Shokat stressed that if drugs could be created that would bind to all of the amino acids found in mutated KRAS genes, treatments could become exponentially more effective, not just in treating lung cancer, but other KRAS affected cancers like colon and pancreatic, the latter of which being particularly lethal. Finally, Dr. Shokat floated the prospect of finding a drug that could restore TP53 tumor suppressor function, allowing the body itself to gain the upper hand against cancer cell proliferation. A combination of all these drugs could prove a groundbreakingly potent attack against tumor growth, and research is not only ongoing, but incredibly promising.</p>

<p>Recently, residents in ODB may have become aware of one room being gutted as the plaster on the walls was replaced due to mildew and mold. The<em> </em><em>Quest</em> reached out to Director of Facilities Operations Steve Yeadon to clarify the happenings in the century old dorm building.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over winter break, a radiator steam pipe in a student’s room broke, which led to a leak. Upon returning for the semester, the student noticed damage from the steam leak and the resulting mildew and mold that grew. “Because the mildew/mold was fresh, it did not require abatement and was cleaned up with the plaster removal. Facilities had to contract the repair works as it was extensive and specialized work,” Yeadon writes in an email interview. “The space is now repaired to new condition with new plaster, paint, and flooring. Any damaged furniture in the space was also replaced.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the CDC, mold may have some health effects on individuals, particularly those with mold allergies or asthma. Symptoms such as a congested nose, wheezing, and red or itchy eyes/skin may occur with exposure, and respiratory tract symptoms, cough, and wheezing may develop in otherwise healthy individuals. Mold can be detected by a musty smell and/or spots and should be removed when noticed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There is no risk of mold to residents and there is no widespread issue in the building (or on campus) of mold. This was an isolated incident due to the steam leak,” continues Yeadon. As for the student affected, “none of [their] belonging[s] were damaged and the sleeping room was unaffected,” and “Residence Life worked with [them] to find suitable, alternative accommodations while the work is being completed.”</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two Mondays ago on February 6th, STEMGeMs, led by Sofia Pardo, organized a speaker event for Michelle Nijhuis (‘96), a Reed alumni who has since gone on to become an acclaimed journalist focused on the science of conservationism. STEMGeMs is a club that supports gender minorities in STEM. The group hosts speakers, and events such as board game nights, and anti-procrastination study groups. Last week, they hosted Michelle Nijhuis.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While at Reed, Nijhuis majored in biology. Although she always had an interest in writing, she did not study it as a student. Beginning her slide show, Nijhuis showed us a picture of herself fresh out of college, at a job in the Southwest using a (for its time) state of the art GPS, a long rod with a mushroom-like cap on the top. Despite having graduated with a biology degree, Nijhuis said, “I was pretty certain I didn’t want to be a conventional research biologist, because I didn’t think I had that kind of focus.” She knew she had knack for learning, and especially for finding connections between bits of information across different disciplines. “The best choice for me was to become a journalist.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her first foray into the journalism world was as an intern at High Country News, where she still works today, though now as the Acting Editor-in-Chief. While interning there, she discovered her love for journalism. “I knew for sure this was what I wanted to do,” Nijhuis said, “now the question was how to do it.” Journalism and freelancing are not the most stable jobs out there, and she was well aware of that. “People thought I was nuts,” she joked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nijhuis was able to delve so far into journalism and freelancing partly because of the way she lived. When Nijhuis moved to Colorado, her husband (then-boyfriend) had just finished building a beautiful, alternative architecture house right off the grid. Though the income of a freelance journalist (especially one so new) isn’t particularly high, she was able to subsist off of it alongside her husband in that beautiful, solar-paneled house.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having been a journalist for so long, Nijhuis has written more than a few notable articles. One of my personal favorites, at least from the few I’ve read so far, is “Bilbo Baggins is a Girl” – a story about Nijhuis reading The Hobbit to her daughter with a she/her Bilbo Baggins. The story went viral, and some people were upset. “People were mad about Bilbo Baggins being a girl, and then I would say, ‘He’s not real!’” said Nijhuis.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alongside the Bilbo Baggins story, Nijhuis has written a series of award-winning articles on conservationism, climate change, ecology, and more. Furthermore, in 2021, Nijhuis also published a book – <em>Beloved Beasts: Fighting for Life in an Age of Extinction</em>, a history of conservationism and the people who served as turning points within it. “It’s kind of a relay race from one generation to the next,” Nijhuis said, “We usually read about conservationism as isolated icons working by themselves, and what’s clear to me is that it’s nothing like that. People are working together, learning from each other, and disagreeing as well.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of the relevant skills Nijhuis says she learned at Reed include:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><s>How to read</s>…How to skim a scientific paper.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>How to “trespass” in other disciplines. AKA how to learn from other disciplines despite not focusing on them.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>How to see a project through. (Thesis students, looking at you.)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>How to do hard brain stuff.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>How to eat cheaply. (As journalists often do.)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michelle Nijhuis ended the event by listing some of the skills she wishes she could have learned at Reed. Among them were how to aspire to anything other than an academic career, as Reed places heavy emphasis on the academic side of things. Further along the academic standpoint, she said she wished she had learned how to write for general leaders, how to run a business and network, and how to work and live in a more “conventional” setting – as Reed is decidedly unconventional. Lastly, she wished she had learned to be a good collaborator. Reed is a very individualistic environment and doesn’t exactly set up students to work with people both ahead and behind them in their respective fields.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Michelle Nijhuis is one of many Reed alum speakers, and only one of the speakers planned by STEMGeMs. If you’re interested in learning about the events ahead of time, consider signing up for their email list at <a href="http://bit.ly/stemgemslist">bit.ly/stemgemslist</a>! </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A new creative space is growing on campus for pottery enthusiasts, clay creation admirers, or people who just need something in their hands at all times. Ceramics club was started this semester by Miles Silvey and Emily Musgrove, who wanted to create a space where like-minded pottery enthusiasts can get together, hang out, and make art! Because this is a very new space on campus, the<em> </em><em>Quest</em> decided to sit down with Musgrove to learn more about what the club will look like and how Reed students can get involved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last semester, Silvey and Musgrove took a ceramics art class where they developed an affinity for the art form and decided that they needed to create an easily accessible space where other Reedies could work with clay without adding another class to their course load. Musgrove described the club as a general space where students can work together and share feedback with one another. There have been previous attempts in the past of Reed students trying to create an accessible ceramics-making space, but because of the amount of equipment and large space needed, it had never taken off. So, this ceramics club is starting simple. Instead of a sink, they will be using a hose, and instead of a kiln, they will be working with underglaze. While there are no wheels available yet to use, students will still be able to work with clay through hand building and sculpture. Musgrove emphasized that, while they do not know exactly what the club will look like, they are welcoming of people of all experience levels regarding ceramics, stating that it is a great creative outlet, as well as a stress reliever. While they do not currently have a lot of help from the art department, the ceramics club needs volunteers willing to help build basic necessities for the space, such as tables. So, help create a new creative Reed tradition and look out for more information on the ceramics club in student body info and around campus!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senate Public on Monday began with a full audience, with senators having to set up an extra two rows of folding chairs for a crowd of almost 40 people — a stark contrast to the usual five or so of us in the audience. This week’s public had a theme — House Advisor applications. With the recent changes to the HA role, many current and former HA’s came out to voice their concerns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before addressing House Advisor concerns, Senate announced that applications for J-Board secretary and the Student Committee on Diversity (SCOD) are now open on Handshake, “so apply if either of those interest you,” said Senator Jefferson Ratliff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, Student Body Head Treasurer Wani Pandey recommended the allocation of $600 to Tango Club, $654 to Chess Club, $252 to Masquerade Ball, $150.01 to Rave Reed, $15 to Rugby, and $375 to Love Ball. All of the allocations passed unanimously. “We had a great funding hell, thank you to everyone who sent in their budgets,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Relevant to the topic of HA applications, Senator Astrid Liu announced that they are working on a form t0 c0llect student feedback for the policy changes regarding the HA position. They are planning on sending it out later this week. “Keep an eye out for that,” they said.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once Senate finished making their announcements, they opened the floor up to the crowd, who had come to voice their opinions on the description changes to the HA job application. House Advisor applications came out a few weeks ago and closed on Tuesday the 13th. Many students noticed the addition of new requirements on the form, such as requiring HA’s to be “on call,” maintain a 2.4 GPA, and be first responders to medical emergencies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many of the attending crowd worried that the new requirements made the HA position more inaccessible. With regards to the need to maintain a 2.5 GPA, Hailey, one of the first to speak, said, “We’ve all had some really awful semesters here at Reed, so I think to punish somebody for the fact that something happened within their personal life and they can no longer be an HA, I think is a little absurd.” Allegedly, the requirement has been lowered to a 2.4 GPA, though Hailey – and others – still had concerns. Another speaker mentioned that HA’s tend to hold multiple jobs on top of their job as an HA and their work as a student. “We’re already more vulnerable to having a lower GPA, so by adding a GPA requirement, you’re making Reed even more economically inaccessible on top of how much it already is,” they said.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new application also requires HA’s to be “on call” for longer periods of time, with no description of what “on call” actually entails. Despite the extra hours that “on call” seems to imply, the HA position has not seen an increase in pay. Another speaker, Max, had asked for clarification about being “on call,” but reported that they hadn’t received an answer past, “We don’t have information on this yet.” Without a definitive increase in pay, Max continued, “We’d be on call for more hours and less pay, or be paid less for the hours that we worked, and I don’t think that’s fair for my time.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new HA requirements are also particularly detrimental for disabled students. “Lockouts and being on call, expecting us to be awake – for students who experience chronic pain or fatigue-related disability,” said Leo, another student in the audience, “that’ll very rapidly make the HA position incredibly inaccessible to work.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next year’s HA’s will also have to be first responders to medical emergencies, but as far as the current HA’s are aware, they have not received anywhere close to adequate medical training. “We were told to call the CSOs – that was our medical training,” said Max. Generally, students wondered what the plan for next year would be, whether they would be getting training for specific certifications and whether they would be given compensation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many in the audience were dissatisfied with ResLife’s current responses to the situation. The values that ResLife upholds – “academic excellence, community, personal development, respect, and wellness” – were values that Ashley Oliver, a student in the audience, felt were directly challenged by the new HA requirements. “How does implementing these changes with no HA input or advance notice, and not even clarifying what all the requirements of the position will be before we have to decide whether to reapply or not, show any level of respect for HAs?” she asked.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 5:01 pm, President Zengar announced that Public had come to a close. “Thank you so much to all of you for coming and voicing your concerns,” she said, “It takes a lot of courage to stand in front of any group of people and talk about your job and place of work and have very valid dissatisfaction with it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following the end of Public announcement, Dean of Students Tawana Parks stood up within the audience to address the crowd in front of her. “I heard all of your voices. I’m incredibly honored that you shared them,” she said. Parks announced that she is taking responsibility, and took notes on the students’ concerns so that they will be better able to provide responses. “Thank you,” said Parks.</p>

<p><em>Wait, something looks a little familiar here</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Names: Mavis &amp; Dylan</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Breed: Schnauzapoo &amp; Cockapoo</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Age: 2 &amp; 3 Years</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rating: 14/10 &amp; 14/10<br>For those of you who have read the <em>Quest</em> in the Before Times (c.2019/2020) you might recognize one of these pups! On February 14, 2020 we featured Dylan here when she was only six months old! Now, almost exactly three years later, Dylan is a much more mature pup and has a baby sister! Mavis is much more energetic than Dylan is and loves to bark at everything! If you’re not petting her, if she sees another dog or person, or if she wants food, she starts yapping! But she’s still very sweet regardless. Both Dylan and Mavis love pets, and sometimes if Dylan is getting pets, Mavis will push her out of the way. Luckily, people often have two hands and can pet both dogs at once! Dylan has considerably calmed down since the last time she was interviewed. During the previous interview she apparently barked at two different people and ran around the whole time. Nowadays, Mavis is the barker and Dylan is happy just to be pet. They also have fun names! Dylan is named after musician Bob Dylan and Mavis after the musician Mavis Staples. 14/10 for both.<em> Check out <a href="https://reedquest.org/2020/02/14/2020-2-14-dog-of-the-week-forever-young/">https://reedquest.org/2020/02/14/2020-2-14-dog-of-the-week-forever-young/</a> for Dylan’s previous Quest article!</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Checkmate in two moves. Can you find it?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">White to move</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Puzzle credit to Nathaniel Woodrow Wildcat Mills</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How to play:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You are playing as white. You have the next move.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In two moves by white, white will have a checkmate.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When played correctly, this is a “forced checkmate,” meaning no matter how black moves, a checkmate is always assured. This <em>often</em> means that black only has one possible move (which <em>often</em> means each of white moves are checks!)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hint: Great sacrifices lead to great rewards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Answer to this week's puzzle:<br>Qh8+, Kh8, Rf8#</p>
